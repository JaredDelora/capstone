Les Misérables,"  Act I In 1815 France, prisoners work at hard labour (""Work Song""). After 19 years in prison (five for stealing bread for his sister's starving son and her family, and the rest for trying to escape), Jean Valjean, ""prisoner 24601"", is released on parole by the prison guard Javert. By law, Valjean must display a yellow ticket of leave, which identifies him as an ex-convict (""On Parole""). As a convict, Valjean is shunned wherever he goes and cannot find regular work with decent wages or lodging, but the Bishop of Digne offers him food and shelter. Desperate and embittered, Valjean steals the Bishop's silver and flees. He is captured by the police, but rather than turn him in, the Bishop lies and tells the police that the silver was a gift, giving Valjean a pair of silver candlesticks in addition. The Bishop tells Valjean that he must use the silver ""to become an honest man"" and that he has ""bought (Valjean's) soul for God"" (""Valjean Arrested, Valjean Forgiven""). Ashamed and humbled by the Bishop's kindness, Valjean resolves to redeem his sins (""Valjean's Soliloquy"" / ""What Have I Done?""). He tears up his yellow ticket, breaking his parole but giving himself a chance to start a new life free from the stigma of his criminal past.Eight years later, in 1823, Valjean has assumed a new identity as Monsieur Madeleine, a wealthy factory owner and mayor of Montreuil-sur-Mer. Fantine is a single mother working in his factory, trying to support her daughter Cosette, who is being raised by an innkeeper and his wife while Fantine labours in the city. Unbeknownst to Valjean, the factory foreman lusts after Fantine, and when she rejects his advances, he takes it out on the other workers, who resent her for it. One day, a coworker steals a letter about Cosette from Fantine, revealing to the other workers that Fantine has a child. A fight breaks out, and the foreman and other workers use the incident as a pretence to fire Fantine (""At the End of the Day""). Fantine reflects on her broken dreams and about Cosette's father, who abandoned them both (""I Dreamed a Dream""). Desperate for money, she sells her locket and hair, finally becoming a prostitute (""Lovely Ladies""). When she fights back against an abusive customer, Bamatabois, Javert, now a police inspector stationed in Montreuil-sur-Mer, arrives to arrest her. But Valjean, passing by the scene, pities Fantine, and when he realises she once worked for him and that she blames him for her misfortune, he is guilt-stricken. He orders Javert to release her and takes her to a hospital (""Fantine's Arrest"").Soon afterwards, Valjean rescues a man, Fauchelevent, who is pinned by a runaway cart (""The Runaway Cart""). Javert, who has up until now not recognised Valjean, though he has pursued him as a fugitive all these years, witnesses the incident and becomes suspicious, remembering the incredible strength Valjean displayed in the work camp. But it turns out another man has been arrested, and is about to go to trial for breaking parole. The real Valjean realises that this case of mistaken identity could free him forever, but he is not willing to see an innocent man go to prison in his place and so confesses his identity to the court (""Who Am I?—The Trial""). At the hospital, a delirious Fantine dreams of Cosette. Valjean promises to find Cosette and protect her (""Come to Me"" / ""Fantine's Death""). Relieved, Fantine succumbs to her illness and dies. Javert arrives to take Valjean back into custody, but Valjean asks Javert for time to fetch Cosette. Javert refuses, insisting that a criminal like Valjean can never change or do good. They struggle, but Valjean overpowers Javert and escapes (""The Confrontation"").In Montfermeil, the duplicitous innkeepers, the Thénardiers, use Cosette as a servant and treat her cruelly while extorting money from Fantine by claiming that Cosette is regularly and seriously ill, as well as demanding money to feed and clothe Cosette, all the while indulging their own daughter, Éponine. Cosette dreams of a life with a mother where she is not forced to work and is treated lovingly (""Castle on a Cloud""). The Thénardiers cheat their customers, stealing their possessions and setting high prices for low-quality service, and live a life of criminal depravity (""Master of the House""). Valjean meets Cosette while she's on an errand drawing water and offers the Thénardiers payment to adopt her (""The Bargain""). The Thénardiers feign concern for Cosette, claiming that they love her like a daughter and that she is in fragile health, and bargain with Valjean, who pays them 1,500 francs in the end. Valjean and Cosette leave for Paris (""The Waltz of Treachery"").Nine years later, in 1832, Paris is in upheaval because of the impending death of General Lamarque, the only man in the government who shows mercy to the poor. Among those mingling in the streets are the student revolutionaries Marius Pontmercy and Enjolras, who contemplate the effect Lamarque's death will have on the poor and desperate in Paris; the Thénardiers, who have since lost their inn and now run a street gang which consists of thugs Brujon, Babet, Claquesous, and Montparnasse; the Thénardier's daughter Éponine, who is now grown and has fallen in love with Marius (who is oblivious to her affections); and the streetwise young urchin Gavroche, who knows everything that happens in the slums (""Look Down""). The Thénardiers prepare to con some charitable visitors, who turn out to be Valjean and Cosette, who has grown into a beautiful young woman. While the gang bamboozles her father, Cosette runs into Marius, and the pair fall in love at first sight. Thénardier suddenly recognises Valjean, but before they can finish the robbery, Javert, now an inspector stationed in Paris, comes to the rescue (""The Robbery""). Valjean and Cosette escape, and only later (when Thénardier tips him off) does Javert suspect who they were. Javert makes a vow to the stars – which represent his belief in a just and ordered universe where suffering is a punishment for sin – that he will find Valjean and recapture him (""Stars""). Meanwhile, Marius persuades Éponine to help him find Cosette (""Éponine's Errand"").At a small café, Enjolras exhorts a group of idealistic students to prepare for revolution. Marius interrupts the serious atmosphere by fantasising about his new-found love, much to the amusement of his compatriots, particularly the wine-loving Grantaire (""The ABC Café—Red and Black""). When Gavroche brings the news of General Lamarque's death, the students realise that they can use the public's dismay to incite their revolution and that their time has come (""Do You Hear the People Sing?""). At Valjean's house, Cosette thinks about her chance meeting with Marius and later confronts Valjean about the secrets he keeps about his and her own past (""Rue Plumet—In My Life""). Éponine leads Marius to Cosette's garden. He and Cosette meet again and confess their mutual love, while a heartbroken Éponine watches them through the garden gate and laments that Marius has fallen in love with another (""A Heart Full of Love""). Thénardier and his gang arrive, intending to rob Valjean's house, but Éponine stops them by screaming a warning (""The Attack on Rue Plumet""). The scream alerts Valjean, who believes that the intruder was Javert. He tells Cosette that it's time once again for them to go on the run, and starts planning for them to flee France altogether.On the eve of the 1832 Paris Uprising, Valjean prepares to go into exile; Cosette and Marius part in despair; Enjolras encourages all of Paris to join the revolution as he and the other students prepare for battle; Éponine acknowledges despairingly that Marius will never love her; Marius is conflicted whether to follow Cosette or join the uprising; Javert reveals his plans to spy on the students; and the Thénardiers scheme to profit off the coming violence. Marius decides to stand with his friends, and all anticipate what the dawn will bring (""One Day More""). Act II As the students build a barricade to serve as their rally point, Javert, disguised as a rebel, volunteers to ""spy"" on the government troops. Marius discovers that Éponine has disguised herself as a boy to join the rebels and, wanting to keep her away from the impending violence, he sends her to deliver a farewell letter to Cosette. (""Building the Barricade—Upon These Stones"") Valjean intercepts the letter and learns about Marius and Cosette's romance. Éponine walks the streets of Paris alone, imagining that Marius is there with her, but laments that her love for Marius will never be reciprocated (""On My Own"").The French army arrives at the barricade and demands that the students surrender (""At the Barricade—Upon These Stones""). Though Javert tells the students that the government will not attack that night (""Javert's Arrival""), Gavroche recognises him and quickly exposes him as a spy, and the students detain Javert (""Little People""). Their plan is to spark a general uprising with their act of defiance, hoping that all the people of Paris will side with them and overwhelm the army. Éponine returns to find Marius but is shot by the soldiers crossing the barricade. As Marius holds her, she assures him that she feels no pain and reveals her love for him before dying in his arms (""A Little Fall of Rain""). The students mourn this first loss of life at the barricades and resolve to fight in her name, and they carry her body away while Enjolras attempts to comfort Marius, who is heartbroken over the death of his best friend. Valjean arrives at the barricade, crossing the government lines, disguised as a soldier (""Night of Anguish""), hoping that he might somehow protect Marius in the coming battle for Cosette's sake. The rebels are suspicious of him at first, but when the army attacks, Valjean saves Enjolras by shooting at a sniper and scaring him off, and they accept him as one of them. In return, he asks Enjolras to be the one to execute the imprisoned Javert, which Enjolras grants. But as soon as Valjean and Javert are alone, Valjean frees Javert. Javert warns Valjean that he will not give up his pursuit and rejects what he perceives as a bargain for Valjean's freedom. Valjean says there are no conditions to his release, and holds no ill-will toward Javert for doing his duty (""The First Attack"").The students settle down for the night and reminisce about the past while also expressing anxiety about the battle to come. Enjolras tells the other students to stay awake in case the enemy strikes unexpectedly in the night, but he tells Marius to get some sleep, knowing Marius is still much too devastated over losing Éponine to stay awake. Grantaire gets angry and asks the students if they fear to die as Marius wonders if Cosette will remember him if he dies (""Drink with Me""). As Marius sleeps, Valjean prays to God to protect Marius, even if the cost for Marius' safety is his own life (""Bring Him Home""). As dawn approaches, Enjolras realises that the people of Paris have not risen up with them, but resolves to fight on in spite of the impossible odds (""Dawn of Anguish""). Their resolve is fired even further when the army kills Gavroche, who snuck out to collect ammunition from bodies on the other side of the barricade (""The Second Attack / Death of Gavroche""). The army gives a final warning, but the rebels fight to the last man with Enjolras exhorting ""Let others rise to take our place, until the Earth is free!"". Everyone at the barricade is killed except Valjean and a gravely wounded Marius, who escape into the sewers (""The Final Battle""). Javert returns to the barricade, searching for Valjean amongst the bodies, and finds the open sewer grating.Valjean carries Marius through the sewers but collapses in exhaustion. While he is unconscious, Thénardier, who has been looting bodies (""Dog Eats Dog""), comes upon them and takes a ring from the unconscious Marius, but flees when Valjean (whom he again recognises) regains consciousness. When Valjean carries Marius to the sewer's exit, he finds Javert waiting for him. Valjean begs Javert for one hour to bring Marius to a doctor, and Javert reluctantly agrees. Javert finds himself unable to reconcile Valjean's merciful acts with his conception of Valjean as an irredeemable criminal. Refusing to compromise his principles but no longer able to hold them sacred, he finds himself torn between his beliefs about God and his desire to adhere to the law and commits suicide by throwing himself into the Seine (""Soliloquy/Javert's Suicide"").In the wake of the failed revolution, women mourn the deaths of the students (""Turning"") and Marius, wounded but alive, despairs at the sacrifice of so many lives and at the death of his friends while he survives (""Empty Chairs at Empty Tables""). As he wonders who saved his own life, Cosette comforts him, and they reaffirm their blossoming romance. Valjean realises that Cosette will not need him as a caretaker once she's married and gives them his blessing (""Every Day""). Valjean confesses to Marius that he is an escaped convict and must go away because his presence endangers Cosette (""Valjean's Confession""), making Marius promise never to tell Cosette. A few months later, Marius and Cosette marry (""Wedding Chorale""). The Thénardiers  crash the reception disguised as nobility and attempt to blackmail Marius, telling him that Valjean is a murderer and that Thénardier saw him carrying a corpse in the sewers after the barricades fell. When Thénardier shows him the ring as proof, Marius realises that it was Valjean who saved his life. The newlyweds leave to find Valjean (in some productions, Marius pauses to give Thénardier a punch in the face). The Thénardiers are not discouraged, instead gloating that their craven practicality has saved their lives time and time again (""Beggars at the Feast"").At a convent, Valjean awaits his death, having nothing left to live for. The spirit of Fantine appears to him and tells him that he has been forgiven and will soon be with God. Cosette and Marius arrive to find Valjean near death. Valjean thanks God for letting him live long enough to see Cosette again, and Marius thanks him for saving his life (""Epilogue – Valjean's Death""). Valjean gives Cosette a letter confessing his troubled past and the truth about her mother. As he dies, the spirits of Fantine and Éponine guide him to Heaven reminding him that ""to love another person is to see the face of God."" They are joined by the spirits of those who died at the barricades, who sing that in the next world, God lays low all tyranny and frees all oppressed people from their shackles (""Do You Hear The People Sing? (Reprise)"").","The musical takes place at the beginning of the XIX century. After 19 years of penal servitude, Jean Valjean is released by policeman Javert.

The Phantom of the Opera,"  Prologue In 1911 Paris, the Paris Opéra hosts an auction of old theatrical props. Among the attendees is the Vicomte Raoul de Chagny, who purchases a papier-mâché music box and eyes it sadly, remarking how the details are ""exactly as she said."" The auctioneer presents the next item for bid, ""lot 666"", ""a chandelier in pieces"", alluding to a connection with ""the Phantom of the Opera"". As the porters remove the drop cloth covering the fixture, it flickers to life and ascends to the ceiling as the auditorium's former grandeur is restored (""Overture""). Act I It is now 1881 and the cast of a new production, Hannibal, are rehearsing onstage when they learn that new owners, Firmin and André, are taking over the Paris Opéra House (""Hannibal Rehearsal""). Carlotta, the Opéra's resident soprano prima donna, begins to perform an aria for the new managers when a backdrop inexplicably falls from the flies, barely missing her and prompting anxious chorus girls to whisper, ""He's here! The Phantom of the Opera!"". The managers try to downplay the incident, but Carlotta angrily insists that such things have been happening for ""three years"" and she storms out, quitting the show. Madam Giry, the Opéra's ballet mistress, informs Firmin and André that Christine Daaé, a chorus girl and orphaned daughter of a prominent violinist, has been ""well taught"" and can sing Carlotta's role. With cancellation of the sold-out show being their only other alternative, the managers reluctantly audition her and are surprised to discover that she is indeed talented. As Christine sings the aria during the evening performance, the Opéra's new patron, Raoul, the Vicomte de Chagny, recognises her as his childhood friend and playmate (""Think of Me"").Backstage after her triumphant début, Christine confesses to her friend Meg, Madam Giry's daughter, that she knows her mysterious teacher only as an invisible ""Angel of Music"" (""Angel of Music"") who sings to her in her dreams. Raoul pays a visit to Christine's dressing room and the two reminisce about the ""Angel of Music"" stories that her late father used to tell them. Christine confides that the Angel has visited her and taught her to sing (""Little Lotte""). Raoul indulges what he assumes are fantasies and insists on taking Christine to dinner. When Raoul leaves to fetch his hat, Christine hears the jealous Phantom's voice and entreats him to reveal himself. The Phantom obliges by appearing as a ghostly, partially masked face in her mirror (""The Mirror/Angel of Music (Reprise)""). Believing him to be the Angel of Music sent by her deceased father, Christine is irresistibly drawn through the mirror to the Phantom, who leads her down into the cellars of the Opéra house. The two then board a small boat and cross a subterranean lake to his secret lair (""The Phantom of the Opera""). The Phantom explains that he has chosen Christine to sing his music and serenades her. When he reveals a mirror that reflects an image of her in a wedding dress, the figure in the mirror gestures to Christine and she faints from shock. The Phantom then covers her tenderly with his cloak and puts her on a bed (""The Music of the Night"").As the Phantom is composing music at his organ, Christine awakens to the sound of the monkey music box (""I Remember""). Overcome with curiosity, she slips behind the Phantom, lifts his mask, and beholds his grotesquely disfigured face. The Phantom rails at her prying gesture and Christine runs in fear. He then ruefully expresses his longing to be loved (""Stranger Than You Dreamt It""). Moved by pity, Christine returns the mask to the Phantom and he escorts her back above ground.Meanwhile, Joseph Buquet, the Opéra's chief stagehand, regales the chorus girls with tales of the ""Opéra Ghost"" and his terrible Punjab lasso. Madam Giry arrives and warns Buquet to exercise restraint or face the Phantom's wrath (""Magical Lasso""). In the managers' office, André and Firman read notes from the Phantom and are interrupted by Raoul, who accuses them of sending him a note saying that he should make no attempt to see Christine again. Carlotta and Piangi then burst in, demanding to know who sent Carlotta a note warning that her ""days at the Opéra Populaire are numbered."" As André and Firmin try to calm Carlotta, Madam Giry delivers another note from the Phantom: he demands that Christine replace Carlotta as the Countess in the new opera, Il Muto, and that Box 5 be kept empty for him. The managers are warned they will face a ""disaster beyond imagination"" if these demands are not met (""Notes""). Firmin and André assure the furious Carlotta that she will remain their star and Christine will play the Pageboy, a silent role (""Prima Donna"").The première of Il Muto initially goes well, until the voice of the Phantom suddenly cuts through the performance, enraged that Box 5 was not kept empty for him as he had directed. As Christine whispers that she knows the Phantom is near, Carlotta reminds her that her role is silent, calling her a ""little toad"". The Phantom states that it is Carlotta who is the toad and reduces the diva's voice to a frog-like croak. Firmin rushes to defuse the situation by announcing to the audience that Christine will take over the starring role, and he instructs the conductor to bring the ballet forward to keep the audience entertained. Suddenly, the corpse of Joseph Buquet drops from the rafters, hanging from the Punjab lasso. Firmin and André plead for calm as mayhem erupts and the Phantom's sinister laugh is heard throughout the auditorium (""Poor Fool, He Makes Me Laugh"").In the ensuing chaos after Il Muto, Christine escapes with Raoul to the roof and tells him about her subterranean encounter with the Phantom (""Why Have You Brought Me Here?/Raoul, I've Been There""). Raoul is skeptical but promises to love Christine cries in tears and protect her, and Christine reciprocates his vow (""All I Ask of You""). Christine and Raoul go back inside, unaware that the Phantom has overheard their entire conversation. The heartbroken Phantom angrily vows revenge before returning to the auditorium. After the curtain call, the  chandelier crashes on the stage (""I Gave You My Music""). Act Il (Entr'acte) Six months later, during a masquerade ball, the Phantom appears in costume as the Red Death. He announces that he has written an opera entitled Don Juan Triumphant and demands that it be produced with Christine (who is now secretly engaged to Raoul) in the lead role, and he warns of dire consequences if his demands are not met. Noticing an engagement ring on a chain around Christine's neck, the Phantom angrily pulls it from her and vanishes in a blinding flash of light (""Masquerade/Why So Silent"").As the masquerade attendees scatter in fear, Raoul accosts Madam Giry and demands that she reveal what she knows about the Phantom. Madam Giry reluctantly explains that the Phantom is actually a brilliant scholar, magician, architect, inventor, and composer who was born with a terrifyingly deformed face and was ostracized for it. Feared and reviled by society, he was cruelly exhibited in a cage as part of a traveling fair until he eventually escaped and disappeared. He subsequently took refuge beneath the opera house, which has now become his home.Before rehearsals, Raoul plots to use the première of Don Juan Triumphant as a trap to capture the Phantom and put an end to his reign of terror. Carlotta falsely accuses Christine of being the mastermind, suggesting that it is all a ploy to make her the star. Christine angrily defends herself, explaining that she is his victim just like everyone else. Raoul, knowing of the Phantom's obsession with his fiancée, asserts that the Phantom will attend the opera's première and begs a reluctant Christine to help lure the Phantom into the trap, but she refuses (""Notes/Twisted Every Way""). During rehearsal, Piangi is unable to sing his part in the new opera, causing frustration and chaos for everyone. The piano suddenly begins to play the piece by itself (having been possessed by the Phantom) and the entire company immediately sings the proper notes in unison.Torn between her love for Raoul and her awe of the Phantom, Christine visits her father's grave, longing for his guidance (""Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again""). The Phantom appears atop the mausoleum, again under the guise of the Angel of Music (""Wandering Child""). The weary Christine begins to succumb to the Phantom's influence, but Raoul arrives to rescue her. The Phantom taunts Raoul, hurling fire balls at him until Christine begs Raoul to leave with her. Furious, the Phantom declares war upon them both and causes flames to spring up around the mausoleum (""Bravo Monsieur"").With armed policemen having secured the auditorium and watching for the Phantom, Don Juan Triumphant premieres with Christine and Piangi singing the lead roles. During Don Juan's and Aminta's duet, Christine comes to the sudden realization that the Phantom has somehow replaced Piangi (""Don Juan Triumphant/The Point of No Return""). Mimicking Raoul's vow of devotion on the rooftop, the Phantom once again expresses his love for Christine and forces his ring onto her finger. Christine rips off his mask, showing his horrifically deformed face to the shocked audience. Exposed, the Phantom hurriedly drags Christine off the stage and back to his lair. Piangi's garroted body is revealed backstage and the opera house plunges into chaos. An angry mob, vowing vengeance for the murders of Buquet and Piangi, search for the Phantom. Madam Giry tells Raoul how to find the Phantom's subterranean lair and warns him to beware the magical lasso. (""Down Once More/Track Down This Murderer"").Down in the lair, the Phantom has compelled Christine to don a wedding dress. In a moment of epiphany, she explains that she is not fearful of his physical appearance, but rather his inner nature. Raoul reaches the lair and attempts to persuade the Phantom to spare Christine and begs him for compassion. The Phantom retorts that the world had never shown him any and ensnares Raoul in the Punjab lasso. The Phantom offers Christine an ultimatum: if she will stay with him, he will spare Raoul, but if she refuses, Raoul will die (""The Point of No Return Reprise""). As the Phantom and Raoul both vie for Christine, she sadly asks the Phantom what life he has been forced to live. Finally, she tells the Phantom that he is not alone and kisses him, showing him compassion for the first time in his life.Having experienced kindness at last, the Phantom realizes that he cannot win Christine by force and sets them both free. Raoul hurries Christine out of the lair, but she returns alone to give the Phantom back his ring. The Phantom once again pledges his love to her as she tearfully exits the lair to rejoin Raoul. As the angry search mob closes in, the devastated Phantom huddles on his throne beneath his cloak. Meg is first to reach the lair and finds no one there. She approaches the throne with curiosity and quickly pulls away the Phantom's cloak, but finds only his mask. She lifts the mask up into the light and gazes at it in wonder as the curtain falls (""Finale"").","At the beginning of the XX century in the Paris Opera House was selling of old props. The most mysterious lot was broken chandelier. With its fall relates the story of the mysterious Phantom, who many years ago was the music patron of this place. Chandelier again rose to the ceiling of the theater & time turned back. It was 1881. In the hall was rehearsed the evening performance. Appeared Phantom so angered diva Carlotta that she categorically refused to act. New theater owners replaced the lead actress. The young chorus girl Christine knew a whole party of diva. She perfectly performed in the evening & very surprised new owners.  After a triumphant debut of Christine, she told her friend about the mysterious music angel, who taught her singing. Soon, to her came a new sponsor of the theater Viscount & recognized a girl – in a childhood, they often played together. A girl told to a young man her deceased father’s telling, which included such music angel. A girl also admitted that this mysterious patron taught her singing. Laughed at her imagination, he invited her to dine. When the young man left the dressing room, in the mirror appeared Phantom. He took her into the mysterious world, which was located deep underground. Teaching his protégé singing, the patron brought the girl to his home & when she fainted, he gently laid her down on his bed. Waking up, she went to an angel & took off his mask to see the true face of her patron.  Soon theater owners received a note from the Phantom. He demanded that the main role in the new opera performed Christine. Otherwise, the theater would suffer a terrible disaster. Owners calmed down furious diva, assuring her in her irreplaceability. During her performance, Phantom made so that the singer lost her voice. Trying to save the play, owners let the ballet on the stage. But then the audience saw the corpse under the ceiling, hanging on a rope & heard a sinister laugh of Phantom. Using the general turmoil, Christine took Mr. Chagny to the roof of the theater, where they explained to each other in love. Overhearing their conversation, Phantom has vowed to avenge to them two.  After 6 months, Phantom visited Masquerade. He brought the owners a new musical creation & demanded a main part for Christine. Mrs. Giry told to viscount a story of Phantom. He was originally born with a disfigured face, the boy grew up in a mobile waxworks. When he managed to escape from there, the teenager found refuge in the theater. There he realized that his calling is to compose music. Viscount decided to catch the Phantom. Christine was choosing between her beloved & teacher. Visiting her father’s grave, the girl almost fell under the spell of Phantom, but she was rescued by viscount. During the premiere, Christine realized that her partner should be Phantom. When she tore off his mask, the audience saw the mutilated face of a man & he kidnapped a girl from the stage.  Viscount was in search of his beloved, when Mrs. Giry showed a way to the dungeon, where Christine was forced to wear a wedding dress. Phantom soon caught the Viscount, who found a way to Phantom’s habitat. A man said that would let go Viscount, if only a girl stays with him. Otherwise her lover would die. Realizing feelings of Phantom, Christine kissed him. Having experienced the first time in life someone else's compassion, Phantom was shocked. He told the girl that he loves her, but she forced herself to turn away from her mentor. Christine & Viscount left. Closed by pallium, Phantom started to cry. Soon, in his lair broke angry mob. But under the pallium, people only found mask of a men – Phantom disappeared."

During the New York and New Jersey campaign, Hamilton accepts a position as George Washington's aide-de-camp (""Right Hand Man""), instead of field command.At Philip Schuyler's ball (""A Winter's Ball""),  Hamilton meets, falls in love with, and later marries Eliza Schuyler (""Helpless""), as Angelica suppresses her feelings for the sake of their happiness at the wedding (""Satisfied""). After the wedding, Burr congratulates Hamilton on his position as aide-de-camp to Washington; Hamilton confesses that he would much rather have Burr's position on the battlefield (""The Story of Tonight (Reprise)""). Burr reflects on Hamilton's swift rise while considering his own career as more cautious (""Wait For It"").As conditions worsen for the Continental Army, Hamilton aids Laurens in a duel against Charles Lee (""Stay Alive""), who insulted Washington. Laurens injures Lee, who in turn yields (""Ten Duel Commandments""). Hamilton is temporarily suspended by Washington (""Meet Me Inside"") over the duel and is sent home. There, Eliza reveals that she is pregnant with her first child, and asks Hamilton to slow down to take in what has happened in their lives (""That Would Be Enough""). After Lafayette convinces France to get involved on the colonists' side (""Guns and Ships""), he urges Washington to call Hamilton back to help plan the final Siege of Yorktown. Washington agrees but explains to Hamilton—who is convinced he should die a martyr and a hero in war—that he should be careful with his actions because whatever he does will be known for ages to come (""History Has Its Eyes on You""). At the Siege of Yorktown, Hamilton meets up with Lafayette to take down the British, revealing that Mulligan was recruited as a spy, helping them figure out what to do to trap the British and win the war (""Yorktown (The World Turned Upside Down)"").Soon after the victory at Yorktown, King George asks the rebels how they will succeed in governing on their own (“What Comes Next?”). Hamilton's son Philip is born, while Burr has a daughter, Theodosia, and the two tell their children how they will do anything to protect them (""Dear Theodosia""). Hamilton receives word that his friend Laurens has been killed in a seemingly pointless battle after the war was won and throws himself into his work (""Tomorrow There'll Be More of Us""). He co-authors The Federalist Papers and is selected as Secretary of the Treasury by newly elected President Washington. Eliza begs Hamilton to stay. Angelica moves to London with her new husband (""Non-Stop""). Act II Thomas Jefferson returns to America from being the U.S. ambassador to France (""What'd I Miss""). In 1789, Jefferson and Hamilton debate the latter's financial proposals at a Cabinet meeting. Washington pulls Hamilton aside, and tells him to figure out a compromise to win over Congress (""Cabinet Battle #1"").Eliza and her family—along with Angelica, back from London—travel upstate during the summer, while Hamilton stays home to work on the compromise (""Take a Break""). Hamilton begins an affair with Maria Reynolds, making him vulnerable to her husband's blackmail (""Say No To This""). Hamilton, Jefferson, and James Madison create the Compromise of 1790 over a private dinner, exchanging Hamilton's financial plan for placing the country's permanent capital on the Potomac River. Burr is envious of Hamilton's sway in the government and wishes he had similar power (""The Room Where It Happens""). Burr switches political parties and defeats Philip Schuyler, making Hamilton now a rival (""Schuyler Defeated"").In another Cabinet meeting, Jefferson and Hamilton argue over whether the United States should assist France in its conflict with Britain. President Washington ultimately agrees with Hamilton's argument for remaining neutral (""Cabinet Battle #2""). In the wake of this, Jefferson, Madison, and Burr decide to join forces to find a way to discredit Hamilton in Washington's eyes (""Washington on Your Side""). Washington decides to retire from the presidency, and Hamilton assists in writing a farewell address (""One Last Time"").A flabbergasted King George receives word that George Washington has stepped down, and will be replaced by Paris signatory John Adams (“I Know Him”). John Adams becomes the second President and fires Hamilton, who publishes an inflammatory critique of the new president as a response (""The Adams Administration""). In the face of accusations of speculation of government funds by Jefferson, Madison, and Burr—and out of fear that his affair with Maria Reynolds will be used against him in his political career (""We Know"")—Hamilton chooses to publicize his affair (""Hurricane"") in the Reynolds Pamphlet (""The Reynolds Pamphlet""), damaging his relationship with Eliza (""Burn""). Philip, instructed by Hamilton, challenges George Eacker to a duel and is critically injured (""Blow Us All Away"") and dies (""Stay Alive (Reprise)""), causing a reconciliation between Alexander and Eliza (""It's Quiet Uptown"").Hamilton's endorsement of Jefferson in the presidential election of 1800 (""The Election of 1800"") results in further animosity between Hamilton and Burr, who challenges Hamilton to a duel via an exchange of letters (""Your Obedient Servant""). Hamilton writes his last letter in a rush while Eliza tells him to go back to bed (“Best of Wives and Best of Women”). Burr and Hamilton travel to New Jersey for the duel. During the duel, both Burr and Hamilton fire at each other after ten paces, with Hamilton intentionally missing (throwing away) his shot. Hamilton dies as a result, with Eliza and Angelica at his side. Burr laments that even though he survived, he is cursed to be remembered as the villain who killed Hamilton (""The World Was Wide Enough""). The musical closes with a reflection on historical memory, showing how Eliza kept Hamilton's legacy alive (""Who Lives, Who Dies, Who Tells Your Story"").","Can we call a thing more boring than the history? Everyone can remember the long hours spent on the school bench under monotonic and gray monologue of teacher, reading paragraph by paragraph, to enter steadily and firmly in the young stupid heads the chronology from the beginning of times until today. But sometimes there is nothing more fascinating than the history. At all the pages of books, written by bored pundits, contain no drop of inspiration, not a grain of creativity. Musical «Hamilton», created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, is an outstanding example, of how the history should be revealed.  Miranda spent six long years of hard and tireless work on his own brainchild, being inspired by the biography of his native country and its founding fathers, especially the notorious Alexander Hamilton. The plot plunges us into the story of the life of one of the great politicians, says about his childhood, the years of a long and hard studying, and finally, about his formation as a political figure, skillfully touching the threads of fate of great state, during the fight for its independence. The story takes us to the atmosphere of the time, and every detail is thought out so that the film captivates us entirely. This musical is as close to modern musical trends as possible: its motifs include smooth melodies of romantic and lyrical works, and after, the ricochet of hip-hop beats on our hearing. Seemingly boring talks about finances and war, usually prompting boredom on the viewer, now transformed into real musical battles, under hip-hop.  Alexander Hamilton lived before in the minds of only a dry summaries of the handbooks about the history. And his face is on a ten-bill. Now he comes to life and is presented to the audience on the stage as simple, perfectly ordinary mortal person, capable of making mistakes, looking for ways to retreat and solutions, in love or naive, strict or cruel politician – this all matters. He is alive. This story takes us in his journey from the very beginning, proving that we are all humans, no matter how great we were. It captivates and attracts. So much, that tickets on this presentation fly out with incredible speed, and many famous people of our time (for example, President Barack Obama and lots of movie stars) considered it as their duty to attend the musical. And more than once!"
West Side Story,"  Act 1 Two rival teenage gangs, the Jets (White Americans) and the Sharks (Puerto Rican Americans), struggle for control of their neighborhood on the Upper West Side of New York City (Prologue). They are warned by police officers Krupke and Lt. Schrank to stop fighting on their beat. The police chase the Sharks off, and then the Jets plan how they can assure their continued dominance of the street. The Jets' leader, Riff, suggests setting up a rumble with the Sharks. He plans to make the challenge to Bernardo, the Sharks' leader, that night at the neighborhood dance. Riff wants to convince his friend and former member of the Jets, Tony, to meet the Jets at the dance. Some of the Jets are unsure of his loyalty, but Riff is adamant that Tony is still one of them (""Jet Song""). Riff meets Tony while he's working at Doc's Drugstore to persuade him to come. Tony initially refuses, but Riff wins him over. Tony is convinced that something important is round the corner (""Something's Coming"").Maria works in a bridal shop with Anita, the girlfriend of her brother, Bernardo. Maria has just arrived from Puerto Rico for her arranged marriage to Chino, a friend of Bernardo's. Maria confesses to Anita that she is not in love with Chino. Anita makes Maria a dress to wear to the neighborhood dance.At the dance, after introductions, the teenagers begin to dance; soon a challenge dance is called (""Dance at the Gym""), during which Tony and Maria (who aren't taking part in the challenge dance) see each other across the room and are drawn to each other. They dance together, forgetting the tension in the room, and fall in love, but Bernardo pulls his sister from Tony and sends her home. Riff and Bernardo agree to meet for a War Council at Doc's, a drug store which is considered neutral ground, but meanwhile, an infatuated and happy Tony finds Maria's building and serenades her outside her bedroom (""Maria""). She appears on her fire escape, and the two profess their love for one another (""Tonight""). Meanwhile, Anita, Rosalia, and the other Shark girls discuss the differences between the territory of Puerto Rico and the mainland United States of America, with Anita defending America, and Rosalia yearning for Puerto Rico (""America"").The Jets get antsy while waiting for the Sharks inside Doc's Drugstore. Riff helps them let out their aggression (""Cool""). The Sharks arrive to discuss weapons to use in the rumble. Tony suggests ""a fair fight"" (fists only), which the leaders agree to, despite the other members' protests. Bernardo believes that he will fight Tony, but must settle for fighting Diesel, Riff's second-in-command, instead. This is followed by a monologue by the ineffective Lt. Schrank trying to find out the location of the rumble. Tony tells Doc about Maria. Doc is worried for them while Tony is convinced that nothing can go wrong; he is in love.The next day, Maria is in a very happy mood at the bridal shop, as she anticipates seeing Tony again. However, she learns about the upcoming rumble from Anita and is dismayed. When Tony arrives, Maria asks him to stop the fight altogether, which he agrees to do. Before he goes, they dream of their wedding (""One Hand, One Heart""). Tony, Maria, Anita, Bernardo and the Sharks, and Riff and the Jets all anticipate the events to come that night (""Tonight Quintet""). The gangs meet under the highway and, as the fight between Bernardo and Diesel begins, Tony arrives and tries to stop it. Though Bernardo taunts and provokes Tony, ridiculing his attempt to make peace, Tony keeps his composure. When Bernardo pushes Tony, Riff punches him in Tony's defense. The two draw their switchblades and get in a fight (""The Rumble""). Tony attempts to intervene, inadvertently leading to Riff being fatally stabbed by Bernardo. Tony kills Bernardo in a fit of rage, which in turn provokes an all-out fight like the fight in the Prologue. The sound of approaching police sirens is heard, and everyone scatters, except Tony, who stands in shock at what he has done. The tomboy Anybodys, who stubbornly wishes that she could become a Jet, tells Tony to flee from the scene at the last moment and flees with the knives. Only the bodies of Riff and Bernardo remain. Act 2 Blissfully unaware of the gangs' plans for that night, Maria daydreams with her friends, Rosalia, Consuelo, Teresita and Francisca, about seeing Tony (""I Feel Pretty""). Later, as Maria dances on the roof happily because she has seen Tony and believes he went to stop the rumble, Chino brings the news that Tony has killed Bernardo. Maria flees to her bedroom, praying that Chino is lying. Tony arrives to see Maria and she initially pounds on his chest with rage, but she still loves him. They plan to run away together. As the walls of Maria's bedroom disappear, they find themselves in a dreamlike world of peace (""Somewhere"").Two of the Jets, A-Rab and Baby John, are set on by Officer Krupke, but they manage to escape him. They meet the rest of the gang. To cheer themselves up, they lampoon Officer Krupke, and the other adults who don't understand them (""Gee, Officer Krupke""). Anybodys arrives and tells the Jets she has been spying on the Puerto Ricans; she has discovered that Chino is looking for Tony with a gun. The gang separates to find Tony. Action has taken charge; he accepts Anybodys into the Jets and includes her in the search.A grieving Anita arrives at Maria's apartment. As Tony leaves, he tells Maria to meet him at Doc's so they can run away to the country. In spite of her attempts to conceal it, Anita sees that Tony has been with Maria, and launches an angry tirade against him (""A Boy Like That""). Maria counters by telling Anita how powerful love is (""I Have a Love""), and Anita realizes that Maria loves Tony as much as she had loved Bernardo. She admits that Chino has a gun and is looking for Tony. Lt. Schrank arrives to question Maria about her brother's death, and Anita agrees to go to Doc's to tell Tony to wait. Unfortunately, the Jets, who have found Tony, have congregated at Doc's, and they taunt Anita with racist slurs and eventually attempt rape. Doc arrives and stops them. Anita is furious, and in anger spitefully delivers the wrong message, telling the Jets that Chino has shot Maria dead.Doc relates the news to Tony, who has been dreaming of heading to the countryside to have children with Maria. Feeling there is no longer anything to live for, Tony leaves to find Chino, begging for him to shoot him as well. Just as Tony sees Maria alive, Chino arrives and shoots Tony. The Jets, Sharks, and adults flock around the lovers. Maria holds Tony in her arms (and sings a quiet, brief reprise of ""Somewhere"") as he dies. Angry at the death of another friend, the Jets move towards the Sharks but Maria takes Chino's gun and tells everyone that ""all of [them]"" killed Tony and the others because of their hate for each other, and, ""Now I can kill too, because now I have hate!"" she yells. However, she is unable to bring herself to fire the gun and drops it, crying in grief. Gradually, all the members of both gangs assemble on either side of Tony's body, showing that the feud is over. The Jets and Sharks form a procession, and together carry Tony away, with Maria the last one in the procession.","The two gangs – Jets, consisting of white & Sharks, including the Puerto Ricans – fought for control in West Side district. The leader of the first ones decided on the next dance to challenge Bernardo, the leader of the second. Riff called for challenge the gang’s member who grew up & now was working at a pharmacy, Tony. At first, he refused, but then he allowed himself to be persuaded. The newly arrived Maria worked in the store along with Anita, the girlfriend of his brother Bernardo, Sharks’ leader. A girl was supposed to marry Chino, but she did not feel any senses to him. Anita helped her prepare the dress for dancing. During the party, Jets’ & Sharks’ representatives started struggled in the dance. Seeing each other, Tony & Maria stopped noticing others. Soon they began to dance. Then brother sent her home. Bernardo & Riff agreed to hold a meeting on neutral territory. Tony fell in love with Maria at a first sight. He came to her house & started singing serenades under her window. When a girl came out onto the fire escape, the young people explained each other in their feelings.  During the meeting, participants of bands confirmed – only fists are allowed during the battle. Bernardo was thinking that he would have to fight Tony, but Riff stood against him his the second fighter. Maria found out in the morning from Anita about the upcoming fight. She asked Tony to stop the planned clash. The young man promised to do everything he could. The boy & the girl began to dream about the wedding. During the fight, Tony tried to convince Bernardo to stop the fight. But in response, he heard nothing but ridicule. When the Sharks leader pushed him, Riff hit Bernardo. Tony tried to stop a broke out fight. By chance, he caused the death of his friend from Bernardo’s knife. In anger, the boy killed the leader of Sharks. When there was the sound of police sirens, shocked Tony realized that now on his hands was the blood of Maria’s brother. He was hardly persuaded to flee from the crime scene.  Maria was is ignorance thinking about her beloved. When Chino came home & told about Bernardo’s death by Tony’s hand, woman did not believe him. But then her beloved confirmed this to Maria.

Soon members of the Jets gang learned that armed with a gun Chino is looking for Tony. They also began to search for their friend. When upset Anita came to killed Bernardo’s house, she saw a young man leaving from Maria. Angry at first, she then realized that their feelings were stronger than death. Anita told her friend about Chino & his gun. She later agreed to send a message to Tony.  When a girl went to look for the young man, she was attacked by Jets. They were stopped by the pharmacy owner. Angry Anita deceived members of the gang, saying that Chino has shot Maria dead. The pharmacist told Tony about her words, who dreamed of a peaceful & happy life with his beloved. The young man went to Chino, so he shot him too. At the last moment, the young man was able to see alive Maria. Beloved died at the hands of a girl. Members of both bands decided to figure out their relationship over Tony's body.

Teenagers from both bands came to the body of Tony & helped Maria carry him. Their feud ended."
Wicked,"  Act I In the Land of Oz, the Ozians are rejoicing over the demise of Elphaba, the Wicked Witch of the West. Glinda the Good Witch talks about Elphaba's past where her mother is seen having an affair with another man, after Elphaba's father, the governor of Munchkinland, goes out of town. As her mother has this affair, her lover gives her a green potion, and she drinks it. She becomes pregnant and gives birth to a baby girl with green skin (""No One Mourns the Wicked""). An Ozian asks Glinda if she and Elphaba were friends. She reluctantly admits that they were, leading Glinda to tell them the story of how they became best friends. A flashback starts with a scene at the college, Shiz University, when Elphaba arrives with her father and younger sister, Nessarose (""Dear Old Shiz""). Due to her green skin, Elphaba's father resents her and showers his affection on Nessarose, who is physically disabled and uses a wheelchair, due to a birth defect that contributed to their mother's death in childbirth. As their father says goodbye, he gives Nessarose a pair of silver slippers. The headshiztress and witch, Madam Morrible, decides to take Nessarose under her protection because Nessarose is disabled and her father's favorite, leaving Elphaba and the beautiful and popular Galinda as roommates, to their chagrin. Elphaba attempts to take back her sister, and her anger makes Nessarose come back into her hands, telekinetically. Madam Morrible recognizes that Elphaba has special powers, and decides to teach her sorcery. She tells Elphaba her powers might allow her to one day work with the Wonderful Wizard of Oz, something Elphaba has dreamed of her whole life (""The Wizard and I""). Both Galinda and Elphaba dislike each other (""What is this Feeling?"") and they fight constantly, even in their classes, such as their history class with Dr. Dillamond, a goat, who is the only animal professor at the university, who is beginning to suffer from discrimination. He tells Elphaba a conspiracy is afoot to stop animals from speaking, and she wants to let the Wizard know, for he would surely stop it (""Something Bad"").Later, the Winkie Prince Fiyero Tigulaar arrives at Shiz and introduces the other students to his philosophy of simply ""Dancing through life"". Fiyero decides to have an orientation party at the Ozdust Ballroom, that evening, and everyone agrees to go. Boq, a Munchkin who has developed a crush on Galinda, tries to ask her to dance with him at the party, but she convinces him to ask Nessarose out, instead, in order to shoo him away, leaving Galinda free to go with Fiyero. Nessarose, who has a crush on Boq, is delighted and tells her sister how Galinda made it happen and how happy it has made her. Galinda gives a black witch's hat to Elphaba to wear at the party, as a prank. At the party that evening, Boq tries to tell Nessarose the real reason he invited her, but is too nice to hurt her feelings (""Dancing Through Life""). She continues to fall for him. Madam Morrible arrives to tell Galinda she can join her sorcery class, at Elphaba's obliging request, and gives her a wand. Elphaba arrives wearing the witch's hat, only to find the other students laughing and staring while she awkwardly dances alone. Galinda feels regretful and goes to dance with Elphaba. Soon, everyone joins them, and the two girls look at each other in a new light. Back in their room, they continue to bond, by sharing secrets. Galinda tells Elphaba that she plans to marry Fiyero and Elphaba tells Galinda about the bottle of green potion, which she sleeps with behind her pillow. The bottle belonged to her mother, who had died, giving birth to Nessarose. Their mother had chewed milk flowers in order for Nessarose to not be born with green skin. Elphaba tells Galinda that she blames herself for her mother's death and her father's resentment. Galinda then decides to give Elphaba a makeover (""Popular"").The next day at class, Dr. Dillamond tells the students that he has been excommunicated. Elphaba wants to help, but no one will stand up with her. Afterward, a replacement teacher arrives and introduce the students to the cage, which will keep animals controlled, so they never learn to speak. The cage being shown contains a small lion cub. Elphaba's fury cannot be contained, and she accidentally casts a spell on her fellow students, causing them to gyrate involuntarily. She and Fiyero steal the lion cub in the cage and escape. They share a tender moment before he leaves to free the lion cub. Elphaba reminds herself how pointless it is to wish for something to happen between them, as he loves Galinda, as it starts to rain (""I'm Not that Girl""). Madam Morrible comes to tell her that the Wizard has decided to meet her. Nessarose and Galinda come to see her off, and Fiyero meets her too. Fiyero gives Elphaba a bouquet of poppy flowers, but ignores Galinda. Galinda tries to win Fiyero's respect by changing her name to ‘Glinda’, in solidarity with Dr. Dillamond, who always mispronounced her name, but Fiyero is not impressed, saying goodbye to Elphaba, instead. Elphaba invites Glinda to the Emerald City with her (""One Short Day"").The girls meet the Wizard of Oz, who turns out to be not quite as intimidating as they thought (""A Sentimental Man""). He promises Elphaba that he will grant her request if she proves herself. Madam Morrible appears; she is the Wizard's new ‘press secretary’. She gives Elphaba an ancient book of spells, called the Grimmerie, which only the magically gifted can read. Elphaba is asked to try a levitation spell on the Wizard's monkey servant, Chistrey. However, the spell does not go the way Elphaba plans. Chistery sprouts wings, and she realizes that the Wizard is the one behind the suppression of the animals. Elphaba realizes the Wizard has no powers and he is merely a fraud. She runs away, and to prevent the truth from getting out, Madam Morrible spreads reports that Elphaba is a ‘wicked witch’. Elphaba then swears revenge on the Wizard for removing speech from the animals. She performs a spell on a broom and flies away from the Emerald City (""Defying Gravity""). Act II Some time later, Elphaba's opposition to the Wizard's regime has earned her the title ’Wicked Witch of the West’. Glinda has become the positive public front of the Wizard's regime, given the title ‘Glinda the Good’ and positioned by The Wizard as the nation's defender against Elphaba (""No One Mourns the Wicked"" (reprise)). A press conference to celebrate Fiyero's appointment as captain of the guard (a position he accepted to find Elphaba) is hijacked by the crowd's panicked rumors about Elphaba, including a story that she can be melted by water. Fiyero is incredulous and not convinced by Glinda's insistence that Elphaba does not want to be found. He is further angered when Madam Morrible announces his engagement to Glinda and runs off. Glinda attempts to keep a cheerful front for the press, but clearly realizes her dream life has come at a great price (""Thank Goodness"").Elphaba pays a visit to Nessarose, now governor of Munchkinland following the death of their father. Nessarose has taken away the rights of the Munchkins in a desperate attempt to keep Boq at her side. Elphaba tries to convince her sister to side with her against the Wizard, but Nessarose is more concerned with her own problems. Elphaba tries to help by giving Nessarose the power to walk, by turning the silver slippers into ‘ruby slippers’. Convinced that Boq must love her now, Nessarose calls for him, but he only sees this as proof that she does not need him anymore and the opportunity to tell Glinda that he loves her. Hurt, Nessarose takes Elphaba's spell book and tries to cast a spell to make Boq fall in love with her. Nessarose mispronounces the words to the spell, and accidentally shrinks Boq's heart, earning the title “Wicked Witch of the East” (""The Wicked Witch of the East""). Elphaba works another spell to save his life, if in a different condition than he was before. When Boq awakens, he is disgusted at his new state as a man made of tin and flees the mansion.Elphaba returns to the Wizard's palace to free the monkey servants, and encounters the Wizard. He tries once again to convince her to work with him, telling her that he is not evil, but just an average man who came into his position by chance, and he offers to redeem Elphaba's reputation (""Wonderful""). She is almost won over, until she sees Dr. Dillamond, under a blanket, who has lost the power of speech. Angered by this, Elphaba accuses the Wizard, but he calls the guards to arrest Elphaba. In response, Fiyero and the guards enter, followed by Glinda. However, Fiyero helps Elphaba escape and leaves with her. Although brokenhearted at Fiyero switching sides with Elphaba (""I'm Not that Girl"" (reprise)), Glinda suggests to the Wizard and Madam Morrible that the way to apprehend Elphaba is to use her sister, Nessarose, as bait, by spreading a rumor that she's in danger, allowing the officials to capture Elphaba once and for all. Madam Morrible agrees and conjures a tornado.Elphaba and Fiyero are both taken by surprise by the strength of their feelings for each other, and promise to always be together (""As Long As You're Mine""). Their happiness is interrupted when Elphaba has a vision of Nessarose being in danger and sees a house flying through the air in a tornado. Before Elphaba leaves to investigate, Fiyero tells her about a castle, Kiamo Ko, that his family owns and in which she can stay.Glinda and Elphaba meet in Munchkinland, the site where Nessarose has been crushed by a house with a girl named Dorothy Gale and a dog named Toto inside. Upon arriving, Elphaba finds out that Glinda has given Dorothy Nessarose's ruby slippers and sent her on her way on the yellow brick road. Fueled by the rivalry over Fiyero, the two have a heated argument and fight. The guards arrive to arrest Elphaba. Fiyero arrives and holds Glinda hostage, until Elphaba is allowed to go free. Glinda pleads for the guards not to harm him, but they do not listen, as they escort Fiyero to a nearby cornfield where they can interrogate and torture him (by crucifixion). Elphaba tries to cast a spell to protect him, but is crestfallen by the limitations of her power. She decides that from this point on, she will live up to her reputation (""No Good Deed"").Later, back at Oz's capital, all of its citizens unite, declaring war on Elphaba, due to the now full-grown lion, that Elphaba and Fiyero rescued, and Boq's testimony against her. Meanwhile, Glinda has realised Madam Morrible, who can control the weather, is responsible for Nessarose's death. Glinda flees in horror to warn Elphaba, as the angry mob sets out to take Kiamo Ko (""March of the Witch Hunters"").Back at the castle, Elphaba has captured Dorothy and Toto, refusing to release them until Dorothy gives Elphaba Nessarose's ruby slippers – the only things left of her dead sister. Glinda travels to Elphaba's castle to warn her of the danger and persuade her to let Dorothy and Toto go. Elphaba refuses, until she receives a letter saying that Fiyero has died. The two women forgive each other, acknowledging they have both made mistakes. To help her in her future, Elphaba gives the Grimmerie to Glinda. The two friends embrace for the last time, before saying goodbye (""For Good""). As the mob arrives, Elphaba tells Glinda to hide, and she watches helplessly from the shadows as Dorothy throws a bucket of water on Elphaba, who appears to melt away and disappear in a cloud of green smoke. Shaken, Glinda sees that all that remains of her friend is her hat and the bottle of the green potion that her mother drank.In the Emerald City, Glinda confronts the Wizard with Elphaba's bottle, which he recognizes as identical to his own. He was Elphaba's biological father, her mother's lover, and the cause of her green skin. He breaks down in sorrow, and Madam Morrible surmises that Elphaba's powers were so strong because she was a child of two worlds. Glinda banishes the Wizard from Oz, and sends Madam Morrible to prison.Meanwhile, back at Kiamo Ko, Fiyero (now a scarecrow) comes to the spot where Elphaba melted. Making sure that no one is watching, he knocks on the floor and out from a trap door steps Elphaba, very much alive; she had pretended to melt to convince her enemies of her death, and to be with Fiyero, who was transformed into a scarecrow by her spell. Before leaving, Elphaba regrets that she will never see Glinda again and tell her that they are alive. Simultaneously, the musical returns to its starting point. Glinda finishes the story and promises the people of Oz that she will properly earn her title as Glinda the Good. As the people celebrate and Glinda quietly mourns, Elphaba and Fiyero leave Oz (""Finale"").","Good Witch Glinda of Oz country reported that the Wicked Witch Elphaba is dead. They used to be friends, and the memories of their life story in Shiz University started.  Elphaba from the very childhood was a rogue child, being born with green skin color, as her mother had used the green elixir. She also had a sister Nessarose in a wheelchair. When the two sisters came to Shiz, the local bosses took custody over Nessarose. Despite the sociable character of Elphaba, the green color of her skin did not allow her to make friends. Gradually, she became friends with her roommate, Glinda. She desperately desired to meet the Wizard of Oz, who allegedly was able to make her look like of a usual person.  Elphaba had feelings for her classmate Fiyero, even though deep down, she knew that she would never be his chosen one. He replied sympathetically, although he also liked Glinda. But their sympathy had no development – Elphaba was sent to the Emerald City to meet the Wizard. Dreams of help with skin color were not justified at girl – the magician used sorcerer girl's abilities to take credit for her miracles. Elphaba in despair stole an ancient magical book, and ran away being dubbed for that the Wicked Witch and it was declared her hunt down. Using magical powers, the sorcerer managed to escape.  As time passed, Fiyero became a captain of the guard and announced the engagement to Glinda, which was now known as the Good Witch. A guy named Bog was also secretly in love with Glinda, though he was loved by Nessarose, who became governor after the death of her father. When Bog decided to confess Glinda his feelings, jealous Nessa has imposed on him inept spell, wishing to deprive the senses to rival. Bog’s heart began to melt, and in order to save him, Elphaba turned him into the Tin Woodman.  Elphaba reconciled with the Wizard. Fiyero felt again the old feelings to Elphaba, and both of them confessed feelings to each other. Meanwhile, a tornado took Dorothy’s house with her dog Toto, and Elphaba sensed trouble: a house fell on her sister Nessarose and the latter died. It turns out that this curse was designed specifically to lure the evil sorceress out and to deal with her.

Chicago,"  Act I Velma Kelly is a vaudevillian who welcomes the audience to tonight's show (""All That Jazz""). Interplayed with the opening number, the scene cuts to February 14, 1928 in the bedroom of chorus girl Roxie Hart, where she murders Fred Casely as he attempts to break off an affair with her.Roxie convinces her husband Amos that the victim was a burglar, and Amos agrees to take the blame. Roxie expresses her appreciation of her husband's willingness to do anything for her (""Funny Honey""). However, when the police mention the deceased's name, Amos belatedly realizes that Roxie has lied to him. Roxie, feeling betrayed, confesses and is arrested. She is sent to the women's block in the Cook County Jail, where several women accused of killing their lovers are held (""Cell Block Tango""); among the inmates is Velma Kelly, revealing herself to have been involved in the death of her husband and sister, though she denies committing the act. The block is presided over by Matron ""Mama"" Morton, whose system of taking bribes (""When You're Good to Mama"") perfectly suits her clientele. She has helped Velma become the media's top murderer-of-the-week and is acting as a booking agent for Velma's big return to vaudeville.Velma is not happy to see Roxie, who is stealing not only her limelight but also her lawyer, Billy Flynn. Roxie convinces Amos to pay for Billy Flynn to be her lawyer (""A Tap Dance""), though Amos lacks the funds. Eagerly awaited by his all-woman clientele, Billy sings his anthem, complete with a chorus of fan dancers (""All I Care About""). Billy takes Roxie's case before realizing Amos doesn't have the money; to make up the difference, he turns the case into a media circus and rearranges her story for consumption by sympathetic tabloid columnist Mary Sunshine (""A Little Bit of Good""), hoping to sell proceeds in an auction. Roxie's press conference turns into a ventriloquist act, with Billy dictating a new version of the truth (""We Both Reached for the Gun"") to the reporters while Roxie mouths the words.Roxie becomes the most popular celebrity in Chicago, as she boastfully proclaims while planning for her future career in vaudeville (""Roxie""). As Roxie's fame grows, Velma's notoriety subsides, and in an act of desperation she tries to talk Roxie into recreating the sister act (""I Can't Do It Alone""). Roxie turns her down, only to find her own headlines replaced by the latest sordid crime of passion (""Chicago After Midnight""). Separately, Roxie and Velma realize there is no one they can count on but themselves (""My Own Best Friend""), and Roxie decides that being pregnant in prison would put her back on the front page. Act II Velma returns to introduce the opening act, resentful of Roxie's manipulation of the system (""I Know a Girl"") and ability to seduce a doctor into saying Roxie is pregnant; as Roxie emerges, she sings gleefully of the future of her unborn (nonexistent) child (""Me and My Baby""). Amos proudly claims paternity, but still, nobody notices him, and Billy exposes holes in Roxie's story by noting that she and Amos had not had sex in four months, meaning if she were pregnant, the child was not Amos's, in hopes that Amos will divorce her and look like a villain, which Amos almost does (""Mr. Cellophane""). Velma tries to show Billy all the tricks she has planned for her trial (""When Velma Takes The Stand""), which Roxie treats skeptically. Roxie, upset with being treated like a ""common criminal"" and considering herself a celebrity, has a heated argument with Billy and fires him; Billy warns her that her kind of celebrity is fleeting and that she would be just as famous hanging from a noose. At that moment, Roxie witnesses one of her fellow inmates, a Hungarian woman who insisted her innocence but could not speak English and whose public lawyer refused to defend her, as she is hanged (""Hungarian Rope Trick"").The trial date arrives, and the now freshly terrified Roxie runs back to Billy, who calms Roxie by suggesting she will be fine so long as she makes a show of the trial (""Razzle Dazzle""). Billy uses Amos as a pawn, turning around and insisting that Amos is actually the father of Roxie's child. Roxie steals all of Velma's schtick, down to the rhinestone garter, to the dismay of Mama and Velma (""Class""). As promised, Billy gets Roxie acquitted, but just as the verdict is announced, some even more sensational crime pulls the press away, and Roxie's fleeting celebrity life is over. Billy leaves, done with the case, admitting that he only did it for the money. Amos tries to get Roxie to come home and forget the ordeal, but she is more concerned with the end of her brief run of fame and admits she isn't pregnant, leaving Amos in the dust.The final scene cuts to a Chicago vaudeville theater, where Roxie and Velma (acquitted off-stage) are performing a new act in which they bittersweetly sing about modern life (""Nowadays""). The former Mary Sunshine, revealed during the trial to actually be a man in drag, takes his natural male form as a pushy vaudeville promoter, shaping Roxie and Velma's dance (""Hot Honey Rag"") to make it as sexy as possible. The show ends with a brief finale (""Finale"").","Two girls of dazzling appearance, each of which was the star of the scenes of various sizes, are found in the same block in prison, where they were jailed for murder that they have done. One of them, a luxurious curvaceous blonde named Roxie, killed her lover – the club frequenter, whom she has despite the presence of her husband – hard laborer that used to work 14 hours a day to ensure his dazzling wife had all she needed. The second, brunette of great importance, star of vaudevilles named Velma, killed her husband and sister, catching them in bed together.  Events take place in Chicago during Prohibition of 1920, so elegant evening dress and men's suits are in fashion, white scarves and dazzling hairstyles.  Prioress of the prison, powerful dark-skinned patron decides to make Velma star again so that in the future, she was useful for her and looks lawyer named Billy Flynn, who did not lose a single such case yet, whom all the prisoners want to receive as a defensive attorney-in-law. But luck is a blue bird and flies not to all. Billie agrees to protect Velma, they build the line of defense and prepare for court. At this time, Roxie gradually moving closer to Velma and her lawyer, she receives the latter also, persuaded to pay her husband-bungler USD 5,000 for her defense. Last initially took the blame for the murder on him, but then, realizing that she shot not ""a robber"", as she told him, but a lover, he refused to accept the blame (""Funny Honey""). But being still in love, he gets the required money and pays the lawyer, so Billie began to defend Roxie.  In the course of the story, Roxie steals all the tricks, used by Velma for the journalists and becomes the star of the press, even inventing that she was pregnant. Her husband confirmed the pregnancy, sincerely believing it. Thanks to this, Velma gradually comes to wane when Roxie overshadows her and make herself the star number one in this prison. As she was a proud personality, she even forgets herself once and in a heat of anger fires her lawyer, quarreling with him. But she had been sobering pretty quickly when she sees one of the prisoners of her block was executed.  At the trial, she does a demonstration play, emphasizing the fact that she is pregnant (""Me and My Baby"") and saying that committed murder in the heat of passion, defending herself from an attacker, afraid not only for her life, but for baby’s. Turning everything brilliantly, her lawyer arranges Roxie acquitted. Afterwards, almost forgotten Velma gets liberation too, but it is not advertised the same as Roxie’s. We meet Velma some time later, when she is not a star anymore, having no regular job, and she even has torn stockings and shawl became shabby. Roxie's husband left her when he found out that there was no child. Roxie and Velma do a new vaudeville show together."

It is revealed that Roger too has HIV which he contracted from his last girlfriend, who committed suicide after learning of her diagnosis, which has caused Roger to fall into depression. Mark leaves the loft while Roger stays home (""Tune Up #3""), trying to compose on his guitar without success; he wishes desperately to write one last song to be remembered by before he dies (""One Song Glory""). An exotic dancer, junkie, and neighbor, Mimi, shows up at their apartment asking for help with lighting her candle, flirting with Roger in the process; however, he is clearly hesitant to return her affections (""Light My Candle""). Meanwhile, Joanne, a lawyer and Maureen's girlfriend, receives a voicemail from her parents (""Voice Mail #2"").At last, the missing Collins enters the apartment, presenting Angel, who is now in full drag and shares the money she made and the amusing story of how she killed a dog to earn it (""Today 4 U""). Mark comes home, and Benny arrives, speaking of Maureen's upcoming protest against his plans to evict the homeless from a lot where he is hoping to build a cyber arts studio. Benny offers that, if they convince Maureen to cancel the protest, then Mark and Roger can officially remain rent-free tenants. However, the two rebuff Benny's offer and he leaves (""You'll See""). Mark leaves the loft again to go help Maureen with the sound equipment for the protest, unexpectedly meeting Joanne at the stage. Initially hesitant with each other, the two eventually bond over their shared distrust of Maureen's ""gaslighting"" and promiscuous behaviours (""Tango: Maureen""). Mark then joins Collins and Angel to film their HIV support group meeting (""Life Support""), while Mimi attempts to seduce Roger alone in his apartment (""Out Tonight""). Roger is extremely upset by Mimi's intrusion, demanding she leave him alone and resisting any romantic feelings he may harbour for her (""Another Day""). After Mimi leaves, Roger reflects on his fear of dying an undignified death from AIDS, while the Life Support group echoes his thoughts (""Will I"").Collins, Mark, and Angel protect a homeless woman from police harassment, but she chastises them (""On the Street""). To lighten the mood, Collins talks about his dream of escaping New York City to open a restaurant in Santa Fe (""Santa Fe""). Soon, Mark leaves to check up on Roger and while alone, Collins and Angel confess their love for each other (""I'll Cover You""). Joanne hectically prepares for Maureen's show, trying to balance all of the people calling her at once (""We're Okay""). Before the performance, Roger apologizes to Mimi, inviting her to come to the protest and the dinner party his friends are having afterwards. At the same time, police, vendors, and homeless people prepare for the protest (""Christmas Bells""). Maureen begins her avant-garde, if not over the top, performance based on ""Hey Diddle Diddle"" (""Over the Moon""). At the post-show party at the Life Café, Benny arrives, criticizing the protest and the group's bohemian lifestyle. In response, Mark and all the café's bohemian patrons defiantly rise up to celebrate their way of living (""La Vie Bohème""). Mimi and Roger each discover that the other is HIV-positive and hesitantly decide to move forward with their relationship (""I Should Tell You"").

Act II The cast lines up to sing together before the plot of the second act begins, affirming that one should measure life ""in love"" (""Seasons of Love""). Afterwards, Mark and Roger gather to break back into their locked apartment with their friends (""Happy New Year""). A new voicemail reveals that Mark's footage of the riot has earned him a job offering at a tabloid news company called Buzzline (""Voice Mail #3""). The others finally break through the door just as Benny arrives, saying he wants to call a truce and revealing that Mimi––who used to be his girlfriend––convinced him to change his mind. Mimi denies rekindling her relationship with Benny, but Roger is upset, and although they apologize to each other, Mimi goes to her drug dealer for a fix (""Happy New Year B"").Around Valentine's Day, Mark tells the audience that Roger and Mimi have been living together, but they are tentative with each other. It is also told that Maureen and Joanne are preparing another protest, and during rehearsal, Maureen criticizes Joanne's controlling behaviour and Joanne criticizes Maureen's promiscuous mannerisms. They break up dramatically following an ultimatum (""Take Me or Leave Me""). Time progresses to spring (""Seasons of Love B""), but Roger and Mimi's relationship is strained by Mimi's escalating heroin usage and Roger's lasting jealousy and suspicion of Benny. Each alone, Roger and Mimi sing of love and loneliness, telling each other how they feel, as they watch Collins nurse Angel, whose health is declining due to AIDS (""Without You""). By the end of the summer, Mark continues to receive calls offering a corporate job at Buzzline (""Voice Mail #4""). A dance is performed representing all the couples' sex lives (""Contact""). At the climax of the number, the two former couples break up, and Angel suddenly dies. At the funeral, the friends briefly come together to share their memories with Collins being the last to reminisce (""I'll Cover You [Reprise]""). Mark expresses his fear of being the only one left surviving when the rest of his friends die of AIDS, and he finally accepts the corporate job offer (""Halloween""). Roger reveals that he is leaving for Santa Fe, which sparks an argument about commitment between him and Mimi, and between Maureen and Joanne. Collins arrives and admonishes the entire group for fighting on the day of Angel's funeral, causing Maureen and Joanne to reconcile, but not Mimi and Roger. The group shares a sad moment, knowing that between deaths and leaving, their close-knit friendships will be breaking up.

The characters' parents, concerned and confused about their respective situations, leave several worried messages on their phones (""Voice Mail #5""). On Christmas Eve, exactly one year having passed, Mark prepares to screen his now-completed film to his friends. Roger has written his song, but no one can find Mimi for him to play it to. Benny's wife, discovering Benny's relationship with Mimi, has pulled Benny out of the East Village. The power suddenly blows and Collins enters with handfuls of cash, revealing that he reprogrammed an ATM at a grocery store to provide money to anybody with the code 'ANGEL'. Maureen and Joanne abruptly enter carrying Mimi, who had been homeless and is now weak and close to death. She begins to fade, telling Roger that she loves him (""Finale""). Roger tells her to hold on as he plays her the song he wrote for her, revealing the depth of his feelings for her (""Your Eyes""). Mimi appears to die, but abruptly awakens, claiming to have been heading into a white light before a vision of Angel appeared, telling her to go back and stay with Roger. The remaining friends gather together in a final moment of shared happiness and resolve to enjoy whatever time they have left with each other, affirming that there is ""no day but today"" (""Finale B"").","The young director Mark lived with his neighbor Roger in the attic. He filmed the surrounding reality, deciding to make the documentary motion picture at this basis. Infected with AIDS composer was trying to write his best song. Soon, in the attic there was a call from their old friend Collins. Their conversation was interrupted in the middle. The next called the owner of the attic Benny. He demanded rent from tenants, although there was no request for that upon arrival. Soon, Mark received a message from former girlfriend Maureen. She asked him to help to support her protest against the demolition of the tent camp in a sandlot. Mark agreed to join.  Roger met his neighbor Mimi, who tried to start a romantic relationship with him. Musician refused to do it, since she was a drug addict. Soon, to the young people came Collins with his savior – robbed man was found in the street by transgender Angel. He not only bound up his wounds, but also bought some new clothes for him. Upon learning that they are united by AIDS, men decided to start dating. Soon Benny came at the attic. The man said that if young people would be able to stop Maureen’s activities, he would not require a rent from them. Mark decided not to let the girl down. Soon, the director went to a meeting on the AIDS topic, to shoot it on camera for his film.  During the protests, Mark met a lesbian Joanne, in the sake of whom Maureen left him. They found a common tongue when discussing friend’s disadvantages. Roger saw Mimi there. Apologizing for his behavior, the musician invited her to dine. Benny tried to pretend that the community of free artists does not exist, but the performance of the man was interrupted by Mark and his friends. They proved the reality of Bohemia and its inhabitants. Seeing his former girlfriend, Benny enraged. But she said that she is no longer afraid of his threats – she was contaminated with AIDS. After that, Roger has agreed to start meeting with Mimi.  The inhabitants of Bohemia began riot when Benny locked the building up. Collins and Angel brought gas-burner to get inside. The owner offered to young people the keys to the attic, but they refused – his behavior was way too suspicious. Angered, Benny said that Mimi slept with him for the sake of this aid. A girl denied everything, but Roger did not believe her. Frustrated, she left for the drugs. The relationship between Mimi and Roger became strained. The same happened with Joanne and Maureen. Only Collins and Angel were happy together, but soon they were separated by the death of a transgender person.  After the funeral, Roger went to Santa Fé. He has written there his best song. The musician went back in New York. Mark has completed his documentary film. No one knew where Mimi lived at the moment. Soon homeless girl was brought by Joanne and Maureen – she was seriously ill. Already dying, Mimi heard the song of Roger. Suddenly, the girl woke up and told that on the way to the white light, she met Angel, who asked her to come back. Love was stronger than death."

He lies to the lionesses about where they are going, and Sarafina (Nala's mother) and Sarabi allow the cubs to go, escorted by Zazu. Simba and Nala formulate a plan and manage to lose Zazu, while Simba brags about his future position (""I Just Can't Wait to Be King"").The cubs go to the graveyard and begin to explore.

He raises an army of hyenas, promising that they will never go hungry again if they support him (""Be Prepared""). Scar takes Simba to a gorge and tells him to wait there. On Scar's signal, the hyenas start a wildebeest stampede into the gorge (""The Stampede""). Scar tells Mufasa that Simba is trapped in the gorge. Mufasa leaps into the stampede and manages to save his son, but as he tries to escape, Scar throws him off the cliff back into the stampede, killing him.

He is haunted by visions of Mufasa and rapidly switches between delusional confidence and paranoid despair (""The Madness of King Scar""). Nala arrives to confront Scar about the famine and Scar decides she will be his queen and give him cubs. Nala fiercely rebukes him and resolves to leave the Pride Lands to find help. Rafiki and the lionesses bless her for her journey (""Shadowland"").Back in the jungle, Timon and Pumbaa want to sleep, but the restless Simba is unable to settle. Annoyed, Simba leaves them, but Timon and Pumbaa lose their courage and follow him. Simba leaps across a fast-moving river and challenges Timon to do the same. Timon falls in and is swept downstream. He grabs a branch over a waterfall and calls for Simba's help, but Simba is paralyzed by a flashback of Mufasa's death. Timon falls from the branch and Simba snaps out of the flashback, rescuing his friend. Simba is ashamed that Timon nearly died because of his recklessness.The three friends settle to sleep and discuss the stars.

Mufasa's spirit appears in the sky and tells Simba he is the one true king and must take his place in the Circle of Life. Reawakened, Simba finds his courage and heads for home. Meanwhile, Nala wakes Timon and Pumbaa to ask where Simba is, and Rafiki appears to tell them all the news. The three of them catch up with him in the Pride Lands, where he witnesses the ruin of his home. Timon and Pumbaa distract some hyenas by doing the Charleston, allowing Simba and Nala to reach Pride Rock.Scar calls for Sarabi and demands to know why the lionesses are not hunting.

Songs * Cut from the show as of June 27, 2010","The show that we see here begins with the tolerant and clever Lion King of the Pridelands, Mufasa, and his lady-monarch Sarabi acquainting their baby boy, Simba to the creatures of the savannah. Mufasa has a brother, Scar (who previously was named as Prince Taka and he is a next-to-the-throne person in the kingdom). Each of the habitants of the jungle looks as if welcomes the offspring, only Mufasa's malefic sibling, Scar, surreptitiously aspire to become a monarch and show this with his outward appearance. Along with his beastly collaborators, the hyenas, Scar organizes a panic run that lead to assassination of Mufasa. Simba, concluding that he caused the cessation of his dad, quietly departs the Pridelands and leaves to nowhere.  Assuming that Simba was gone (also died, perhaps), Scar transforms into a mogul of the territory. Under his guidance, the Pridelands metamorphose into barren lands. By occasion of a fortunate luck, Simba runs onto his ancient associate Pumbaa in the bushes. She tells him of the terrors of Scar's governing and beseeches Simba to come back to the Pridelands. When Simba reverts, he ends up by murdering Scar and restores his thrown to the delight of each the creature of him new kingdom."
The Book of Mormon,"  Act I At an LDS Church Missionary Training Center, devout, supercilious missionary-to-be Elder Kevin Price leads his classmates in a demonstration of the door-to-door method to convert people to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (""Hello!""). Price believes if he prays enough, he will be sent to Orlando, Florida for his two-year mission, but he and Elder Arnold Cunningham, an insecure, compulsive liar, find out that they will instead be sent to Uganda as a pair (""Two by Two""). Price is sure he is destined to do something incredible, while Cunningham is just happy to follow (""You and Me (But Mostly Me)"").Upon arrival in northern Uganda, the two are robbed by soldiers of a local warlord, General Butt-Fucking Naked. They are welcomed to the village by Mafala Hatimbi, where a group of villagers share their daily reality of living in appalling conditions while being ruled by the General. To make their lives seem better, the villagers repeat a phrase that translates as ""Fuck you, God!"" (""Hasa Diga Eebowai"").Price and Cunningham are led to their living quarters by Nabulungi, Hatimbi's daughter. They meet their fellow missionaries stationed in the area, who have been unable to convert anyone to the Church. Elder McKinley, the district leader, teaches Price and Cunningham thought suppression, a widely accepted method of dealing with the negative and upsetting feelings (""Turn It Off""). By the time they go to bed that night, Price is riddled with anxiety, but Cunningham reassures him that he will succeed and that, as his companion, Cunningham will be by his side no matter what (""I Am Here for You"").Price is certain he can succeed where the other elders have failed, teaching the villagers about Joseph Smith through a song that begins as a tribute to Smith but eventually descends into a tribute by Price to himself (""All-American Prophet""). The General arrives and announces his demand for the genital mutilation of all female villagers. After a villager protests, the General murders him. Taking every last measure to protect her, Hatimbi commands Nabulungi to stay in their house with all the doors locked and windows closed. She protests, insisting that the women of the village won't have to stay in hiding if they just listen to the missionaries, as they hold the secrets to liberation, protection, and eternal happiness. Though her protests to go out and talk to them fail, she calms down after remembering how she was moved by Price's promise of an earthly paradise and dreams of going to live in that new land with all of her fellow villagers (""Sal Tlay Ka Siti"").The mission president has requested a progress report on their mission. Shocked by the execution and the reality of Africa, Price decides to abandon his mission and requests a transfer to Orlando, while Cunningham, ever loyal, assures Price he will follow him anywhere (""I Am Here for You [Reprise]""). However, Price unceremoniously dumps him as mission companion. Cunningham is crushed and alone, but when Nabulungi comes to him, wanting to learn more about the Book of Mormon and having convinced the villagers to listen to him, Cunningham finds the courage to take control of the situation (""Man Up""). Act II When the villagers begin to get frustrated at Cunningham's teaching of the Book of Mormon and leave, Cunningham quickly makes up stories by combining what he knows of LDS doctrine with pieces of science fiction and fantasy. Cunningham's conscience (personified by his father, Joseph Smith, hobbits, Lt. Uhura, Darth Vader, and Yoda) admonishes him, but he rationalizes that if it helps people, it surely cannot be wrong (""Making Things Up Again"").Price joyfully arrives in Orlando but then realizes that he is dreaming. He is reminded of the nightmares of hell he had as a child and panics when his nightmare begins once again (""Spooky Mormon Hell Dream""). During this dream he sees Jesus, Satan, Jeffrey Dahmer, Johnnie Cochran, Genghis Khan and Adolf Hitler. Price awakens and decides to re-commit to his mission.Cunningham announces several Ugandans are interested in the church. McKinley points out that unless the General is dealt with, no one will convert. Price, seeing the chance to prove his worth, sets off on the ""mission he was born to do"". After re-affirming his faith, he confronts the General, determined to convert him (""I Believe""). The General is unimpressed and drags Price away.Cunningham concludes his preaching and the villagers are baptized, with Nabulungi and Cunningham sharing a tender moment as they do (""Baptize Me"").  The missionaries feel oneness with the people of Uganda and celebrate (""I Am Africa""). Price is seen in the village doctor's office, having the Book of Mormon removed from his rectum. Meanwhile, the General hears of the villagers' conversion and resolves to kill them all.Having lost his faith, Price drowns his sorrows in coffee. Cunningham finds Price and tells him they need to at least act like mission companions, as the mission president is coming to visit the Ugandan mission. Price reflects on all the broken promises the church, his parents, his friends and life in general made to him.Nabulungi and the villagers perform a pageant for the mission president to ""honor [them] with the story of Joseph Smith, the American Moses"" (""Joseph Smith American Moses""), which reflects the distortions put forth by Cunningham, such as having sex with a frog to cure their AIDS. The mission president is appalled, orders all the missionaries to go home, and tells Nabulungi that she and her fellow villagers are not members. Nabulungi, heartbroken at the thought that she will never reach paradise, curses God for forsaking her (""Hasa Diga Eebowai [Reprise]""). Price has had an epiphany and realizes Cunningham was right all along: though scriptures are important, what is more important is getting the message across (""You and Me (But Mostly Me) [Reprise]"").The General arrives, and Nabulungi is ready to submit to him, telling the villagers that the stories Cunningham told them are untrue. To her shock, they respond that they have always known that the stories were metaphors rather than the literal truth. Price and Cunningham arrive just in time to use Cunningham's lies of the latter being resurrected after being eaten by lions to scare the General and his men away. Price rallies the members of the Church and the Ugandans to work together to make this their paradise. Later, the newly minted Ugandan elders (including the General) go door to door to evangelize ""The Book of Arnold"" (""Tomorrow Is a Latter Day""/""Hello! [Reprise]""/""Encore"").","The two missionaries are shown. One of them is the mega-responsible person, worried about the new believers and is slightly arrogant. The second, though, completely devoted to his work, but is a hopeless nerd and very big liar who does not want to adhere sticky to conversational scripts. Some time after they were formed in the pair by their mentor and sent to Uganda where upon arrival they were immediately robbed by the local military junta. The local ruler is a terrible despot, a collection of all the sins of Mankind in one bottle, due to which the population of the country is mired in poverty and horrible unsanitary conditions, including AIDS.  The local population does not believe in the Christian God, and even constantly sings very blasphemous song. The missionaries are already experiencing some frustration, and they were being taken to a place of residence, where another few people live, their comrades who did not succeed to convert locals in their faith. One of the newcomers is trying to start proselytizing, but locals find him arrogant, and his faith as meaningless. In the meantime, the local kinglet comes to village and arranges outrage by executing one of the villagers on the spot. The second of the newcomers decided to proselytize people in his own way and very happy when one of the locals listens to him.  It is interesting that this preacher has never actually read the Book of Mormons. Therefore, in order to draw the public into believing, he invents stories, lively and interesting, which are seasoned with his personal charm and ability to tell interestingly. He includes folklore in his stories, certain general provisions of the Mormon faith, the Hobbits, Star Wars, as well as some information about his father. Locals accept such living histories quite vividly.  His second mate, experienced failure to work with the people of Uganda, throws his partner and wants to go Orlando. During the packing-up, he has nightmares, partly because he feels remorse because he had abandoned him, losing faith in the success. He wants to re-establish himself in Uganda, but the former partner does not want to accept him. In addition, the second has a success – 10 people have turned to the new faith.  The Mission leaders come to them and congratulate with the successes, calling them one of the most outstanding figures in Africa in terms of acquisition new believers. But after the leadership recognizes that they are not taught the natives their faith, but some nonsense, they stopped their mission and imposed anathema on them. Nonetheless, both continued to live together with locals and preach to them the good and understanding, thereby engendered new faith."
Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street," The citizens of London, who act as a Greek chorus throughout the play, drop a body bag and pour ashes into a shallow grave. Sweeney Todd rises forth (""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd""), and introduces the drama. Act I In 1846, young sailor Anthony Hope and the mysterious Sweeney Todd, whom Anthony has recently rescued at sea and befriended, dock in London. A beggar woman sexually solicits them, appearing to recognize Todd for a moment (""No Place Like London""), and Todd shoos her away. Todd obliquely relates some of his troubled past to Anthony: he was a naive barber, ""removed...from his plate"" by a corrupt judge who lusted after Todd's wife (""The Barber and His Wife""). Leaving Anthony, Todd enters a meat pie shop on Fleet Street, where the owner, the slatternly widow Mrs. Lovett, laments the scarcity of meat and customers (""Worst Pies in London""). When Todd asks after the empty upstairs apartment, she reveals that its former tenant, Benjamin Barker, was transported on false charges by Judge Turpin, who, along with his servant, Beadle Bamford, then lured Barker's wife Lucy to the Judge's home and raped her (""Poor Thing"").Todd's reaction reveals that he is himself Benjamin Barker. Promising to keep his secret, Mrs. Lovett explains that Lucy poisoned herself and that their then-infant daughter, Johanna, became the Judge's ward. Todd swears revenge on the Judge and Beadle, and Mrs. Lovett presents Todd with his old collection of sterling silver straight razors, which persuades Todd to take up his old profession (""My Friends"" and ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" – reprise). Elsewhere, Anthony spies a beautiful girl singing at her window (""Green Finch and Linnet Bird""), and the beggar woman tells him that her name is Johanna. Unaware that Johanna is his friend Todd's daughter, Anthony is immediately enamored (""Ah, Miss""), and he pledges to return for her, even after the judge and Beadle threaten him and chase him away (""Johanna"").In the crowded London marketplace, flamboyant Italian barber Adolfo Pirelli and his simple-minded young assistant Tobias Ragg pitch a dramatic cure-all for hair loss (""Pirelli's Miracle Elixir""). Todd and Lovett soon arrive; as part of his plan to establish his new identity, Todd exposes the elixir as a sham, challenges Pirelli to a shaving competition and easily wins (""The Contest""), inviting the impressed Beadle for a free shave (""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" – reprise 2). Several days later, Judge Turpin flagellates himself in a frenzy over a growing lust for Johanna, but instead resolves to marry her himself (""Johanna – Mea Culpa"").Todd awaits the Beadle's arrival with mounting impatience, but Mrs. Lovett tries to soothe him (""Wait""). When Anthony tells Todd of his plan to ask Johanna to elope with him, Todd, eager to reunite with his daughter, agrees to let them use his barbershop as a safehouse. As Anthony leaves, Pirelli and Tobias enter, and Mrs. Lovett takes Toby downstairs for a pie. Alone with Todd, Pirelli drops his Italian accent and reveals that he is Daniel O'Higgins, Benjamin Barker's former assistant; he knows Todd's true identity and demands half his income for life. Todd overpowers and kills O'Higgins by slitting his throat (""Pirelli's Death"" and ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" – reprise 3). Meanwhile, Johanna and Anthony plan their elopement (""Kiss Me""), while the Beadle recommends Todd's grooming services to the Judge so that the judge may better win Johanna's affections (""Ladies in Their Sensitivities"").Panicked at first on learning of Pirelli's murder, Mrs. Lovett swipes his leftover coin purse and then asks Todd how he plans to dispose of the body. Suddenly, the judge enters; Todd quickly seats him and lulls him with a relaxing conversation (""Pretty Women""). Before Todd can kill the judge, however, Anthony re-enters and blurts out his elopement plan. The angry judge storms out, vowing never to return and to send Johanna away. Todd drives Anthony out in a fit of fury and, reminded of the evil he sees in London, resolves to depopulate the city by murdering his future customers since all people deserve to die: the rich to be punished for their corruption, and the poor to be relieved of their misery (""Epiphany""). While discussing how to dispose of Pirelli's body, Mrs. Lovett is struck by a sudden idea and suggests that they use the bodies of Todd's victims in her meat pies, and Todd happily agrees (""A Little Priest""). Act II Several weeks later, Mrs. Lovett's pie shop has become a successful business, and Toby works there as a waiter (""God, That's Good!""). Todd has acquired a special mechanical barber's chair that allows him to kill clients and then send their bodies directly through a chute into the pie shop's basement bakehouse. Casually slitting his customers' necks, Todd despairs of ever seeing Johanna, while Anthony searches London for her (""Johanna – Quartet""). Anthony finds Johanna locked away in a private lunatic asylum, but barely escapes being placed under arrest by the Beadle. After a day of hard work, while Todd remains fixated on his revenge, Mrs. Lovett envisions a seaside retirement (""By the Sea""). Anthony arrives to beg Todd for help to free Johanna, and Todd, revitalized, instructs Anthony to rescue her by posing as a wigmaker intent on purchasing inmates' hair (""Wigmaker Sequence"" and ""The Ballad..."" – reprise 4). However, once Anthony has departed, Todd sends a letter informing the Judge that Anthony will bring Johanna to his shop just after dark, and that he will hand her over (""The Letter"").In the pie shop, Toby tells Mrs. Lovett of his skepticism about Todd and his own desire to protect her (""Not While I'm Around""). When he recognizes Pirelli's coin purse in Mrs. Lovett's hands, she distracts him by showing him the bakehouse, instructing him how to work the meat grinder and the oven before locking him in. Upstairs, she encounters the Beadle at her harmonium; he has been asked by Lovett's neighbors to investigate the strange smoke and stench from the pie shop's chimney. Mrs. Lovett stalls the Beadle with ""Parlor Songs"" until Todd returns to offer the Beadle his promised ""free shave""; Mrs. Lovett loudly plays her harmonium to cover the Beadle's screams above as Todd dispatches him. In the basement, Toby discovers hair and fingernails in a pie he has been eating, just as the Beadle's fresh corpse comes tumbling through the chute. Terrified, he flees into the London sewers below the bakehouse. Mrs. Lovett then informs Todd that Toby has found out about their secret and must be dealt with.Anthony arrives at the asylum to rescue Johanna, but is exposed when Johanna recognizes him. Anthony draws a pistol given to him by Todd, but cannot bring himself to shoot Jonas Fogg, the corrupt asylum owner; Johanna grabs the pistol and kills Fogg. As Anthony and Johanna flee, the asylum's freed inmates prophesy the end of the world, while Todd and Mrs. Lovett hunt through the sewers for Toby, and the beggar woman fears what has become of the Beadle (""City on Fire/Searching""). Anthony and Johanna (now disguised as a sailor) arrive at Todd's empty shop. Anthony leaves to seek a coach after he and Johanna reaffirm their love (""Ah Miss"" – reprise). Johanna hears the beggar woman entering and hides in a trunk in the barbershop. The beggar woman seems to recognize the room. Todd enters and tries to force her to leave as she again seems to recognize him (""Beggar Woman's Lullaby""). Hearing the Judge outside, a frantic Todd kills the beggar woman, sending her body down the chute barely a moment before the Judge bursts in. Todd assures the Judge that Johanna is repentant, and the Judge asks for a quick splash of cologne. Once he has the Judge in his chair, Todd soothes him with another conversation on women, but this time he alludes to their ""fellow tastes, in women at least"". The Judge recognizes him as ""Benjamin Barker!"" just before Todd slashes his throat and sends him hurtling down the chute (""The Judge's Return""). Remembering Toby, Todd starts to leave, but, realizing he has left his razor behind, returns just as the disguised Johanna rises, horrified, from the trunk. Not recognizing her, Todd attempts to kill her, just as Mrs. Lovett shrieks from the bakehouse below, providing a distraction for Johanna to escape. Downstairs, Mrs. Lovett is struggling with the dying Judge, who claws at her. She then attempts to drag the beggar woman's body into the oven, but Todd arrives and sees the lifeless face clearly for the first time: the beggar woman is his wife Lucy. Todd is horror-struck, accusing Mrs. Lovett of lying to him. Mrs. Lovett frantically explains that Lucy did indeed poison herself, but she lived, though the attempt left her insane. Mrs. Lovett confesses she loves Todd. Todd then feigns forgiveness, dancing manically with Lovett until hurling her into the raging fires of the oven, burning her alive. Full of despair and in shock, Todd embraces the dead Lucy. Toby, now quite insane, crawls up from the sewer babbling nursery rhymes to himself. He picks up Todd's fallen razor, and slits Todd's throat. As Todd falls dead and Toby drops the razor, Anthony, Johanna and some others break into the bakehouse. Toby, heedless of them, begins turning the meat grinder, crooning Mrs. Lovett's previous instructions to him (""Final Scene""). Epilogue The ensemble cast, soon joined by the risen Todd and Mrs. Lovett, sing a reprise of ""The Ballad of Sweeney Todd"" warning against revenge (though admitting that ""everyone does it""). Tearing off their costumes, the company exits. Todd sneers at the audience for a moment and vanishes.","Simple Londoners are burying bag with the corpse, saying about the deceased Sweeney Todd, as of a demonic barber from Fleet Street. They remember terrible things of him. A ghost of barber appears and the story is transferred in the middle of the XIX century.  The young sailor arrives in London with a friend, whom he had rescued on the high seas. The friend’s name is Sweeney Todd. Seaman is glad to see native streets, but for Sweeney it is difficult to see the city where he once was happy. The situation is aggravated by beggar, offering services of a prostitute. They drive her away. Todd tells the tale of a ruined life of a certain barber, who had a wife and daughter, and then his family has been taken away. The judge on false charges exiled barber to Australia and owned his wife with cheating.  After parting with a sailor, Sweeney arrives at the Fleet Street in a small bakery. The hostess is pleased to see anyone – her establishment almost has no attendance, business is unprofitable. Sweeney offers her a joint business, if she would give him a room. A woman is surprised – all bypass her house: once there lived a barber, he was convicted on false charges, his wife was seduced by the judge, and she poisoned herself with arsenic from grief. Daughter Johanna became a student of the person who has arranged this mayhem. When he learned that his wife had died, Todd recognized to the hostess, that he is the same barber, and therefore wants revenge. Hostess agrees to this retribution.  To attract customers to his business, Sweeney is involved in street barbers competition and win it. Now many people, including a judge himself, wish to visit a first-class master. A Sweeney wants to handle with the judge and his assistants, braking down, ending their lives and hiding the bodies. Learning his plans, the owner conceives to use human flesh as the filling for her pies. So it would be possible to hide the crime and at the same time to rescue unprofitable bakery.  Johanna has grew up and turned into a beautiful girl. The judge planned to marry her. But her heart already belongs to someone else – she met a sailor who saved a hairdresser in the sea.  Finally, the judge comes to the barbershop and the Sweeney prepares to retribution. But his friend-sailor spoils his idea. He runs in and announces that he loves Johanna. Angry judge says that he’ll hide his ward, where no one would find her. And hastily leaves the barber shop without shaving. Todd says that from now on anyone who gets in his institution will be killed even if he did not deserve to die.  Business of bakery begins to flourish. Customers praise the meat pies, unaware of what they were prepared. Sweeney equipped his hairdresser's chair in a way, so that the body is delivered straight to the basement adjacent to the kitchen, for butchery. And there a hostess processes the flesh through a meat grinder, preparing pies. And only a beggar-prostitute say of diabolical smoke emanating from the institution, and the evil witch. But nobody listens to her.  The judge concludes his ward Johanna in the clinic, but an undercover sailor manages to infiltrate there and to rescue his beloved. They run away from the hospital and hid in a bakery on Fleet Street. Soon there comes the judge. In order to prevent beggar to interfere with her crazy speeches, Todd kills her. Only in the last minutes of his shaving, judge understands who the barber is, but it is too late for him.  While the hostess intends to burn the corpse of a beggar, Sweeney recognizes his wife in this ragamuffin: she managed to survive after the arsenic, but lost her mind completely. With grief, Todd throws in the oven the bakery owner and laments his wife. A sailor appears, only now realizing what kind of horrors were taking place here. He kills barber with his own razor, ending this bloody mess."
The Sound of Music,"  Act I In Salzburg, Austria, just before World War II, nuns from Nonnberg Abbey sing the Dixit Dominus. One of the postulants, Maria Rainer, is on the nearby mountainside, regretting leaving the beautiful hills (""The Sound of Music""). She returns late to the abbey where the Mother Abbess and the other nuns have been considering what to do about the free-spirit (""Maria""). Maria explains her lateness, saying she was raised on that mountain, and apologizes for singing in the garden without permission. The Mother Abbess joins her in song (""My Favorite Things""). The Mother Abbess tells her that she should spend some time outside the abbey to decide whether she is suited for the monastic life. She will act as the governess to the seven children of a widower, Austro-Hungarian Navy submarine Captain Georg von Trapp.Maria arrives at the villa of Captain von Trapp. He explains her duties and summons the children with a boatswain's call. They march in, clad in uniforms. He teaches her their individual signals on the call, but she openly disapproves of this militaristic approach. Alone with them, she breaks through their wariness and teaches them the basics of music (""Do-Re-Mi"").Rolf, a young messenger, delivers a telegram and then meets with the oldest child, Liesl, outside the villa. He claims he knows what is right for her because he is a year older than she (""Sixteen Going on Seventeen""). They kiss, and he runs off, leaving her squealing with joy. Meanwhile, the housekeeper, Frau Schmidt, gives Maria material to make new clothes, as Maria had given all her possessions to the poor. Maria sees Liesl slipping in through the window, wet from a sudden thunderstorm, but agrees to keep her secret. The other children are frightened by the storm. Maria sings ""The Lonely Goatherd"" to distract them.Captain von Trapp arrives a month later from Vienna with Baroness Elsa Schräder and Max Detweiler. Elsa tells Max that something is preventing the Captain from marrying her. He opines that only poor people have the time for great romances (""How Can Love Survive""). Rolf enters, looking for Liesl, and greets them with ""Heil"". The Captain orders him away, saying that he is Austrian, not German. Maria and the children leapfrog in, wearing play-clothes that she made from the old drapes in her room. Infuriated, the Captain sends them off to change. She tells him that they need him to love them, and he angrily orders her back to the abbey. As she apologizes, they hear the children singing ""The Sound of Music"", which she had taught them, to welcome Elsa Schräder. He joins in and embraces them. Alone with Maria, he asks her to stay, thanking her for bringing music back into his house. Elsa is suspicious of her until she explains that she will be returning to the abbey in September.The Captain gives a party to introduce Elsa, and guests argue over the Nazi German Anschluss (annexation) of Austria. Kurt asks Maria to teach him to dance the Ländler. When he fails to negotiate a complicated figure, the Captain steps in to demonstrate. He and Maria dance until they come face-to-face; and she breaks away, embarrassed and confused. Discussing the expected marriage between Elsa and the Captain, Brigitta tells Maria that she thinks Maria and the Captain are really in love with each other. Elsa asks the Captain to allow the children to say goodnight to the guests with a song, ""So Long, Farewell"". Max is amazed at their talent and wants them for the Kaltzberg Festival, which he is organizing. The guests leave for the dining room, and Maria slips out the front door with her luggage.At the abbey, Maria says that she is ready to take her monastic vows; but the Mother Abbess realizes that she is running away from her feelings. She tells her to face the Captain and discover if they love each other, and tells her to search for and find the life she was meant to live (""Climb Ev'ry Mountain""). Act II Max teaches the children how to sing on stage. When the Captain tries to lead them, they complain that he is not doing it as Maria did. He tells them that he has asked Elsa to marry him. They try to cheer themselves up by singing ""My Favorite Things"" but are unsuccessful until they hear Maria singing on her way to rejoin them. Learning of the wedding plans, she decides to stay only until the Captain can arrange for another governess. Max and Elsa argue with the Captain about the imminent Anschluss, trying to convince him that it is inevitable (""No Way to Stop It""). When he refuses to compromise on his opposition to it, Elsa breaks off the engagement. Alone, the Captain and Maria finally admit their love, desiring only to be ""An Ordinary Couple"". As they marry, the nuns reprise ""Maria"" against the wedding processional.While Maria and the Captain are on their honeymoon, Max prepares the children to perform at the Kaltzberg Festival. Herr Zeller, the Gauleiter of the region, demands to know why they are not flying the flag of the Third Reich now that the Anschluss has occurred. The Captain and Maria return early from their honeymoon before the Festival. In view of the Nazi German occupation, the Captain decides the children should not sing at the event. Max argues that they would sing for Austria, but the Captain points out that it no longer exists. Maria and Liesl discuss romantic love; Maria predicts that in a few years Liesl will be married (""Sixteen Going on Seventeen (Reprise)""). Rolf enters with a telegram that offers the Captain a commission in the German Navy, and Liesl is upset to discover that Rolf is now a committed Nazi. The Captain consults Maria and decides that they must secretly flee Austria. German Admiral von Schreiber arrives to find out why Captain von Trapp has not answered the telegram. He explains that the German Navy holds him in high regard, offers him the commission, and tells him to report immediately to Bremerhaven to assume command. Maria says that he cannot leave immediately, as they are all singing in the Festival concert; and the Admiral agrees to wait.At the concert, after the von Trapps sing an elaborate reprise of ""Do-Re-Mi"", Max brings out the Captain's guitar. Captain von Trapp sings ""Edelweiss"", as a goodbye to his homeland, while using Austria's national flower as a symbol to declare his loyalty to the country. Max asks for an encore and announces that this is the von Trapp family's last chance to sing together, as the honor guard waits to escort the Captain to his new command. While the judges decide on the prizes, the von Trapps sing ""So Long, Farewell"", leaving the stage in small groups. Max then announces the runners-up, stalling as much as possible. When he announces that the first prize goes to the von Trapps and they do not appear, the Nazis start a search. The family hides at the Abbey, and Sister Margaretta tells them that the borders have been closed. Rolf comes upon them and calls his lieutenant, but after seeing Liesl he changes his mind and tells him they aren't there. The Nazis leave, and the von Trapps flee over the Alps as the nuns reprise ""Climb Ev'ry Mountain"".","Shortly before the outbreak of World War II in the Austrian monastery was a novice Maria Rainer. Young woman had a great love to life & activity. Because of this, the prioress asked a girl to rethink a decision to depart from worldly concerns. Young woman was sent to work as a bonne for Georg von Trapp – the captain of the Austrian fleet, who had 7 kids and whose wife died. Arriving in the mansion, a young woman was surprised to maritime discipline that has been maintained in the officer's family. His children were dressed in a uniform & executed the orders of their father following the special boatswain signals. Maria frowned upon seeing these methods of education & decided to instill a love to music to own wards. Soon governess noticed that 16-year-old Liesl had some mutual feelings to young messenger Rolf.  After a month on the von Trapp’s villa came Elsa & Max. The woman did not understand why the captain still had not married her. Soon Rolf came on villa. When Rolf man greeted everyone in Nazi’s way, the girl's father angrily reminded a boy of his Austrian roots, not German. Seeing children playing in clothes made from old cloth by Maria, Georg was very angry. When the young woman excused herself, Georg forgiven her. Heart of von Trapp softened after the children sang a song written by Elsa. Maria prepared their performance. Soon the 11-year-old Kurt asked governess to teach him dancing. His father decided to show a son proper dance movements. After a girl danced with Georg, she was confused. 10-year-old Brigitta said a girl & Trapp seemed like lovers.  Hearing the children singing, Max invited them to perform at the festival. Maria quietly went to the monastery after all fell asleep. Prioress advised the woman to find out what the captain felt towards her. If he loved her, it was better for a governess to stay with von Trapp. Georg told his family about a future marriage to Elsa. Frustrated children calmed down only after Maria returned. Learning about the wedding, the woman decided to stay with them for as long as a replacement would be found for her. During the dispute about politics, captain proved himself as an opponent of the Nazis. Because of this, Elsa terminated their engagement. Georg soon admitted Maria in his feelings & they married soon. When on the villa reappeared Rolf, bringing a telegram, they all saw that he turned into a convinced Nazi. High Command ordered the captain to cooperate with the German Navy, but the Austrian did not comply with this requirement.  Having received no response, German admiral arrived to von Trapp. Georg said that he could not begin to work, as he & his children must shortly perform at the festival. Admiral agreed to wait until the end of the holiday. After the performance of von Trapp’s family, the jury began to distribute the awards. The victory went to the captain & his children, but no one came to get the first prize. Their family already fled & hid in a monastery, as the borders have been closed already. During the search, the captain & the Nazis with Rolf, who became lieutenant, came to inspect the abbey. Seeing hiding Liesl with family, the young man said that no one was in the abbey. After the departure of the Nazis, Georg, Maria & the children had gone to the Alps. They secretly crossed the Austrian border & left the country."
Fiddler on the Roof,"  Act I Tevye, a poor Jewish milkman with five daughters, explains the customs of the Jews in the Russian shtetl of Anatevka in 1905, where their lives are as precarious as the perch of a fiddler on a roof (""Tradition""). At Tevye's home, everyone is busy preparing for the Sabbath meal. His sharp-tongued wife, Golde, orders their daughters, Tzeitel, Hodel, Chava, Shprintze and Bielke, about their tasks. Yente, the village matchmaker, arrives to tell Golde that Lazar Wolf, the wealthy butcher, a widower older than Tevye, wants to wed Tzeitel, the eldest daughter. The next two daughters, Hodel and Chava, are excited about Yente's visit, but Tzeitel illustrates how it could have bad results (""Matchmaker, Matchmaker""). A girl from a poor family must take whatever husband Yente brings, but Tzeitel wants to marry her childhood friend, Motel the tailor.Tevye is delivering milk, pulling the cart himself, as his horse is lame. He asks God: Whom would it hurt ""If I Were a Rich Man""?  The bookseller tells Tevye news from the outside world of pogroms and expulsions. A stranger, Perchik, hears their conversation and scolds them for doing nothing more than talk. The men dismiss Perchik as a radical, but Tevye invites him home for the Sabbath meal and offers him food and a room in exchange for tutoring his two youngest daughters. Golde tells Tevye to meet Lazar after the Sabbath but does not tell him why, knowing that Tevye does not like Lazar. Tzeitel is afraid that Yente will find her a husband before Motel asks Tevye for her hand. But Motel resists: he is afraid of Tevye's temper, and tradition says that a matchmaker arranges marriages. Motel is also very poor and is saving up to buy a sewing machine before he approaches Tevye, to show that he can support a wife. The family gathers for the ""Sabbath Prayer.""After the Sabbath, Tevye meets Lazar for a drink at the village inn, assuming mistakenly that Lazar wants to buy his cow. Once the misunderstanding is cleared up, Tevye agrees to let Lazar marry Tzeitel – with a rich butcher, his daughter will never want for anything. All join in the celebration of Lazar's good fortune; even the Russian youths at the inn join in the celebration and show off their dancing skills (""To Life""). Outside the inn, Tevye happens upon the Russian Constable, who has jurisdiction over the Jews in the town. The Constable warns him that there is going to be a ""little unofficial demonstration"" in the coming weeks (a euphemism for a minor pogrom). The Constable has sympathy for the Jewish community but is powerless to prevent the violence.The next morning, after Perchik's lessons with the younger sisters, Tevye's second daughter Hodel mocks Perchik's Marxist interpretation of a Bible story. He, in turn, criticizes her for hanging on to the old traditions of Judaism, noting that the world is changing. To illustrate this, he dances with her, defying the prohibition against opposite sexes dancing together. The two begin to fall in love. Later, a hungover Tevye announces that he has agreed that Tzeitel will marry Lazar Wolf. Golde is overjoyed, but Tzeitel is devastated and begs Tevye not to force her. Motel arrives and tells Tevye that he is the perfect match for Tzeitel and that he and Tzeitel gave each other a pledge to marry. He promises that Tzeitel will not starve as his wife. Tevye is stunned and outraged at this breach of tradition, but impressed at the timid tailor's display of backbone. After some soul-searching (""Tevye's Monologue""), Tevye agrees to let them marry, but he worries about how to break the news to Golde. An overjoyed Motel celebrates with Tzeitel (""Miracle of Miracles"").In bed with Golde, Tevye pretends to be waking from a nightmare. Golde offers to interpret his dream, and Tevye ""describes"" it (""Tevye's Dream""). Golde's grandmother Tzeitel returns from the grave to bless the marriage of her namesake, but to Motel, not to Lazar Wolf. Lazar's formidable late wife, Fruma-Sarah, rises from her grave to warn, in graphic terms, of severe retribution if Tzeitel marries Lazar. The superstitious Golde is terrified, and she quickly counsels that Tzeitel must marry Motel. While returning from town, Tevye's third daughter, the bookish Chava, is teased and intimidated by some gentile youths. One, Fyedka, protects her, dismissing the others. He offers Chava the loan of a book, and a secret relationship begins.The wedding day of Tzeitel and Motel arrives, and all the Jews join the ceremony (""Sunrise, Sunset"") and the celebration (""The Wedding Dance""). Lazar gives a fine gift, but an argument arises with Tevye over the broken agreement. Perchik ends the tiff by breaking another tradition: he crosses the barrier between the men and women to dance with Tevye's daughter Hodel. The celebration ends abruptly when a group of Russians rides into the village to perform the ""demonstration"".  They disrupt the party, damaging the wedding gifts and wounding Perchik, who attempts to fight back, and wreak more destruction in the village. Tevye instructs his family to clean up the mess. Act II Months later, Perchik tells Hodel he must return to Kiev to work for the revolution. He proposes marriage, admitting that he loves her, and says that he will send for her. She agrees (""Now I Have Everything""). They tell Tevye that they are engaged, and he is appalled that they are flouting tradition by making their own match, especially as Perchik is leaving. When he forbids the marriage, Perchik and Hodel inform him that they do not seek his permission, only his blessing. After more soul searching, Tevye relents – the world is changing, and he must change with it (""Tevye's Rebuttal""). He informs the young couple that he gives them his blessing and his permission.Tevye explains these events to an astonished Golde. ""Love,"" he says, ""it's the new style."" Tevye asks Golde, despite their own arranged marriage, ""Do You Love Me?"" After dismissing Tevye's question as foolish, she eventually admits that, after 25 years of living and struggling together and raising five daughters, she does. Meanwhile, Yente tells Tzeitel that she saw Chava with Fyedka.  News spreads quickly in Anatevka that Perchik has been arrested and exiled to Siberia (""The Rumor/I Just Heard""), and Hodel is determined to join him there. At the railway station, she explains to her father that her home is with her beloved, wherever he may be, although she will always love her family (""Far From the Home I Love"").Time passes. Motel has purchased a used sewing machine, and he and Tzeitel have had a baby. Chava finally gathers the courage to ask Tevye to allow her marriage to Fyedka. Again Tevye reaches deep into his soul, but marriage outside the Jewish faith is a line he will not cross. He forbids Chava to speak to Fyedka again.

Chava returns and tries to reason with him, but he refuses to speak to her and tells the rest of the family to consider her dead. Meanwhile, rumors are spreading of the Russians expelling Jews from their villages. While the villagers are gathered, the Constable arrives to tell everyone that they have three days to pack up and leave the town. In shock, they reminisce about ""Anatevka"" and how hard it will be to leave what has been their home for so long.As the Jews leave Anatevka, Chava and Fyedka stop to tell her family that they are also leaving for Kraków, unwilling to remain among the people who could do such things to others. Tevye still will not talk to her, but when Tzeitel says goodbye to Chava, Tevye prompts her to add ""God be with you.""  Motel and Tzeitel go to Poland as well but will join the rest of the family when they have saved up enough money. As Tevye, Golde and their two youngest daughters leave the village for America, the fiddler begins to play.

We meet a Jewish family, where the poor milkman has five daughters and sharp-tongued wife, preparing for Shabbat dinner.

Everybody is excited about the event, except for this girl who wants to marry a poor but hardworking, young and beautiful tailor with whom they have a mutual love. Her dad reflects on these plans (Tevye's Monologue) and thinks about harmony, not to force his daughter to marry and keep her unhappy for all life, but says nothing aloud.  During work, Tevye was talking to a friend who says about the hard political situation in their country – with pogroms and expelling the Jews. The occasional fellow traveler rebukes them for the fact that they only talk but do nothing more. Tevye invites one to his home so that he watched after a few of his daughters. After Saturday, the head of the family gives consent to the wedding of an old butcher and his eldest daughter, so she would never experienced a need. And then he meets the local constable, who warns that the main ethnic group of the country is going to do soon pogroms of Jews in this settlement. Due to the chagrin of his daughter that he decided to have a wedding with another, but not with her beloved, the latter comes to her father and says that he wants to marry her and that she will never starve. Upon reflection, he agrees to it and now he must reveal the change of plans for his wife and manqué husband. But his wife sees herself in the dream from the dead relatives that they are in favor of this marriage, and very fast agrees with her husband. Another of the daughters begins to meet secretly with a local guy, not from her commune.  During the pre-wedding ceremony, when all bring gifts, local skinheads come and smash the ceremony, spoiling endowments and causing injury to one of the guests, and depart unpunished.  Then another daughter with her lover ask father a blessing to their marriage followed love and he, after some resistance, gives in to them, knowing that he must change with the times, explaining this position to his wife, who amazed that he started to retreat from tradition too often. After a while, the groom of one of daughters is exiled for his revolutionary views and daughter volunteered to follow her husband, bitterly leaving father's house.  Months later, a poor tailor bought a new sewing machine and his family expects. One of the daughters, meeting with a man of not her commune, asked father to allow their marriage, to which he cannot consent. And then they are caught-up with the news that all the Jews are expelled from their homes and must go out of the country. Affected people have only 3 days. Married eldest daughter and her husband depart to Poland, together with another married sister, and the head of the family with his wife and the rest of daughters depart to America.

The mother of poor inciting him to sell the cow and Red Ridinghood comes to the local baker to bring the pastries to a sick grandmother. The cause of infertility of a baker is the curse of an evil witch, because somehow his father had stolen vegetables from the garden of witch, for which she bewitched his family, taking away from them a little just-born daughter Rapunzel (juridical example of how the punishment is excessively disproportionate to misdemeanor). The condition for removing the curse is to find 4 items, which she didn’t get herself for her magic. After circumstances of several people intertwined together, all of them depart in the woods: Ridinghood carries pies, poor man is going to sell his cow, and a childless couple looking for the missing items.  Along the way, to them happens one by one such events: Cinderella gets a nice outfit from the ghost of her mother, Ridinghood encounters, of course, on charming grandiloquent wolf, and the poor man on the road comes across some geezer who offers a cow in exchange for the beans. Then a childless couple buys his cow for magic beans indeed (although none of the participants of the exchange transaction does believe in this their property), feeling remorse, but in the hope to see their daughter alive, they’ll do anything. Then the baker steals red headdress of Ridinghood, but she is beating in the ongoing hysteria and he returns it. Rapunzel, meanwhile, found in her hideout in the woods by prince, accidentally spying for insidious witch and he decides to climb up to her.  The wolf eats the poor Ridinghood, but baker from mercenary motives (he needs a red cap, because a witch demanded it among the ingredients), kills the wolf, freeing her and her grandmother. Ridinghood gives him a hat, Cinderella escapes from the ball (without her brougham, often mentioned in other tales) and hiding in the house of baker’s wife, who wants to steal away from her golden shoe to give the witch a third ingredient. But future victim of theft escapes and releases the cow, depriving the baker's wife of two ingredients. Giant beanstalk starts to grow. The poor man is taken on it, in giant house and stealing their gold to buy the cow, but discovers that the cow ran away and embarks on her quest. Meanwhile, both princes – Cinderella's and Rapunzel's, discussing the renouncement from these beautiful girls, lamenting on the cruel fate.  Baker and his wife mine required elements (although 3 of 4) and want to finish the quest, because the evil witch has imposed a curse on them, ending within 3 days. The poor man is now on the scene with a chicken that lays golden eggs – he stole it from the same giant’s house. Cow dies at midnight. Witch kicks Rapunzel out of the house, cutting off her magic hair, because she wanted to be with a handsome prince, and not with her. The poor man visits the giant house in heaven for the third time, trying to profit from them even more.  Another magical bean sprouts in a large stem, Cinderella exchanges her shoe, instead of a dead cow another one bought and now the 4 elements assembled by couple of bakers. In an unsuccessful attempt to enrich, poor man woke up the giant, he chased him until the poor man cutted down the stem, and the giant died from hitting the ground. The dead cow is summoned back to life, she was fed with the remaining 3 magical elements and provided a magical milk, which is actually a potion to a witch, who becomes a beautiful girl and the spell collapses. Cinderella's prince searching for his beloved, during which process, her evil stepsisters cut off her toes, trying to wear the shoe, and Rapunzel gives birth to twins in the desert. Witch can harm nobody no more, because all her spells were lost along with this drank potion. Stepsisters of Cinderella were blinded by birds as revenge for the sufferings that caused to her.  The second act begins with the fact that the characters have returned to a quiet life, but only the second bean still grows. The former poor man is rich now and has well nutrition, a childless couple gave birth to the child, and Cinderella is in languish. Suddenly, the wife of the giant gets down to the ground and began to smash all around, including the house of the grandmother of Red Ridinghood; the princes of the kingdom, as it seems, do not care about the pogroms by monster. Former poor decides to murder giant and storylines of the main characters are intertwined that way they are again in the forest, but now the mood of all is the more sinister.  Rapunzel went insane, fled into the forest and met there two princes, who escaped from a boring life with their wives-princesses Sleeping Beauty & Snow White. Giant meanwhile destroyed the village and gets to the castle, and then comes to the forest, wanting to kill Jack to calm down, but the group decides to give it a narrator, as the most useless member of their pride."
Dear Evan Hansen,"  Act 1 Evan Hansen is a teenager with social anxiety. His therapist recommends that he write letters to himself detailing what will be good about each day. His mother, Heidi, suggests that he asks people to sign the cast on his arm to make friends. The wealthy Murphy family consists of the parents, Cynthia and Larry, and their children Zoe and Connor. Cynthia struggles with the fact that her family is falling apart, and the two mothers wonder how to connect with their sons  (""Anybody Have a Map?"").At school, Evan meets Alana, a precocious but somewhat self-absorbed classmate, and Jared, his only (family) friend. Both Alana and Jared notice his broken arm, but neither signs his cast. Evan then runs into Connor, who interprets Evan's awkwardness as making fun of him, resulting in Connor's pushing Evan to the ground. Connor's sister Zoe, whom Evan has a crush on, feels obligated to apologize for her brother's behavior. Evan wonders if this is his destiny — to be ignored and an outcast — for the rest of his life (""Waving Through a Window"").Evan writes a letter to himself, wondering whether anyone would notice if he were not there. All his hope is focused on Zoe, since his crush on her is the only thing that brings him happiness (""Waving Through a Window"" (Reprise #1)). He encounters Connor again, who now offers to sign Evan's cast. Connor finds Evan's letter on the printer and reads it; he becomes furious at the mention of Zoe, thinking Evan intended for him to see the letter in order to make fun of him. He storms out, taking the letter with him.Evan is in an intense state of anxiety over what Connor might have done with the letter and tells Jared online about his assignment to write letters to himself. Evan is called to the principal's office and is told by Connor's parents that Connor committed suicide days before, with Evan's letter found in his pocket, which they believe is a suicide note addressed to him.Evan goes to Connor's house for dinner. Jared had instructed him to ""nod and confirm"" to avoid making things worse, but Evan is awkward and uncomfortable and he lies, pretending he and Connor had been best friends, emailing each other from a secret account.  The Murphys don't question this because Mr. Murphy had been monitoring Connor's real account. Zoe and Cynthia get into an argument, and Evan jumps in, recounting a fictional version of the day he broke his arm at an abandoned apple orchard the Murphys had visited (""For Forever""). When Evan gets home, Heidi mentions hearing about Connor's death, but Evan tells her not to worry and that he didn't know Connor. After realizing he needs evidence of his supposed ""secret email account"", Evan enlists Jared's help in creating fake, backdated email conversations between himself and Connor (""Sincerely, Me"").After Evan shows the Murphy family Connor's ""emails"", Cynthia is ecstatic that her son had a friend, but Larry is hurt that Connor took his family and his privileged life for granted. Cynthia tries to show Zoe the emails, but they argue again. Zoe still refuses to mourn Connor (""Requiem""). Despite this, after reading the ""suicide note"", Zoe notices that she is mentioned and asks Evan why Connor would say that about her. Evan, unable to tell her the truth, tells her all the reasons he loves her under the guise of Connor saying them (""If I Could Tell Her""). Overcome with emotion, he impulsively kisses Zoe, but she pulls away and tells him to leave.At school, Evan and Alana notice that people are starting to forget about Connor, so Evan enlists Alana and Jared's help in founding ""The Connor Project"" to keep Connor's memory alive. The three pitch the idea to the Murphys, who agree to support the project (""Disappear""). Moved by his dedication, Cynthia gives Evan a necktie she had gotten for Connor that he had never worn and asks Evan to wear it when he speaks at Connor's memorial service. At the official launch of The Connor Project, Evan gives an inspiring speech about his loneliness and friendship with Connor, which goes viral. Zoe, overcome by the impact her brother and Evan have had, kisses him (""You Will Be Found""). Act 2 Evan and Alana pitch a fundraising idea on The Connor Project's website, to raise $50,000 to reopen the abandoned apple orchard where Evan and Connor supposedly spent time. However, Evan becomes preoccupied with his new relationship with Zoe and his newfound family in the Murphys, and begins to neglect his mother, Jared, and The Connor Project (""Sincerely, Me"" (Reprise))Heidi asks Evan why he did not tell her about The Connor Project or about his friendship with Connor. He angrily responds that he did not have the time because she is never around. Overcome with emotion, he rushes off to the Murphys, where Evan bonds with Larry Murphy and confides in him about his childhood. Larry offers him an old baseball glove of Connor's that was never used. (""To Break in a Glove""). Later, when Evan begins to mention Connor, Zoe tells him that she does not want their relationship to be about Connor, but about the two of them (""Only Us"").Evan goes to the Murphys, only to discover they invited Heidi for dinner. She is mortified to learn they want to give Connor's college fund to Evan. At home, Heidi and Evan fight over his secrecy and deception, with Evan confessing that he feels welcomed and accepted into the Murphy family because of Heidi's absence. Meanwhile, Alana begins to find inconsistencies in the fake emails. Evan asks Jared to help fix the inaccuracies, but Jared refuses and threatens to expose Evan, who counters that he could expose Jared's role. Heidi, Alana, and Jared converge in Evan's conscience, compounding his guilt and doubt over his decisions (""Good for You"").Evan decides he has to confess to what he has done. Imaginary Connor attempts to talk him out of it, but Evan shouts that he needs the whole thing to be over. Connor tells him that if he tells the truth, all he has will be gone, and the only thing he will be left with is himself (""For Forever"" (Reprise)). He disappears, leaving Evan alone.Evan apologizes to Alana, but she has given up on Evan's help with The Connor Project as she doubts the truth of his statements that he was Connor's best friend. Evan shows her the letter to himself that he wrote when he was giving up on having a good year, claiming it to be Connor's suicide note. Realizing that the letter is the key to fulfilling the fundraising goal, Alana posts it online where, to Evan's chagrin, it goes viral. As a result, many people begin to believe Connor's suicide was because of his uncaring, wealthy parents (""You Will Be Found"" (Reprise)).The Murphys have become the targets of hateful comments because people believe they were responsible for Connor's death. Evan, distraught, walks in on the Murphys fighting about why Connor really killed himself.  Evan admits his fabrication, hopeful that he could forge a genuine bond with the Murphys out of the tragedy. As Zoe and her mother tearfully leave, Larry turns away from Evan in disgust. Alone once more, Evan absorbs his perceived brokenness as inescapable (""Words Fail"").Heidi saw the letter online and knew that it was one of Evan's therapy assignments. She apologizes to Evan for not seeing how badly he had been hurting, though Evan denies her guilt due to his deception. He vaguely admits that his fall from the tree was a suicide attempt. Heidi recalls the day that his father moved out and did not know how she was going to make it by herself. In the end, she realized that she was not alone – she had Evan and knew that the two of them could survive anything so long as they were together. Tearfully, Heidi promises that she will always be there for him when he needs her (""So Big/So Small"").A year later, Evan is still living at home and working at Pottery Barn to earn enough money to go to college the next semester. He contacts Zoe, whom he has not seen since she found out the truth, and asks her to meet him. She insists that they meet at the orchard that has been reopened in Connor's memory. He apologizes for the pain he caused by manipulating her family and admits that he has been reading Connor's ten favorite books in an attempt to connect with who he really was. He thanks her and her parents for keeping his secret and reveals that they never told anyone else that his friendship with Connor was a lie. She forgives him, saying the ordeal brought her family closer together because ""everyone needed it for something."" Evan asks her why she wanted to meet at the orchard, and she replies that she wanted to be sure he saw it, and the two share a gentle moment before they part. Evan mentally writes himself one last letter reflecting on the impact he has had on his community and finally accepts himself (""Finale"").","All his life, Evan Hansen has felt invisible. But when a tragic event shocks the community and thrusts him into the center of a rapidly evolving controversy, Evan is given the opportunity of a lifetime: the chance to be somebody else."
Hairspray,"  Act I It is June 1962 in Baltimore. Tracy Turnblad, an overweight high school student, wakes up (""Good Morning Baltimore"") and goes to school, where she receives a warning for ""inappropriate hair height"". After school, Tracy rushes home with her best friend, Penny, to catch the local teenage dance show, The Corny Collins Show (""The Nicest Kids in Town""). Edna, Tracy's shy and overweight mother, is ironing and complains about the noise of the music coming from the television, while Penny's mother, Prudy, complains about it being race music. After an announcement that auditions for a place on the show will be held due to the fact that Brenda (one of the Corny Collins Council Members) has taken a leave of absence from the show for ""9 months"", Tracy begs her mother for permission to audition. Edna, fearing that Tracy will be laughed at due to her weight, refuses. Penny and Amber (the main dancer on The Corny Collins Show) have similar arguments with their mothers (""Mama, I'm a Big Girl Now"").After gaining permission and support from her father, Wilbur, Tracy auditions for the show and bumps into a teenage heartthrob, Link Larkin, which leads into a dream sequence (""I Can Hear the Bells""). Velma Von Tussle, the racist producer of The Corny Collins Show, rejects Tracy from the audition because of her size (""(The Legend of) Miss Baltimore Crabs""), as well as refusing a black girl, Little Inez.Back at school, Tracy is sent to detention for her ""monumental hair-don't"". There she meets black dancer Seaweed J. Stubbs (the son of the hostess of ""Negro Day"" on The Corny Collins Show, Motormouth Maybelle), who teaches her several dance moves. She uses the new dance steps at the Sophomore Hop the following day to introduce herself to Corny Collins (""The Madison""). When Corny sees how well Tracy can dance, he gives her a place on the show (""The Nicest Kids in Town"" (Reprise)). During the broadcast, Link, following Corny's suggestion, sings ""It Takes Two"" to Tracy, much to Amber's dismay. After the show, Mr Spritzer, the show's worrisome sponsor, appeals to Velma over Tracy's appointment to the Council. Velma, threatening to fire Corny from the show, is eventually left distraught and determines to ruin Tracy (""Velma's Revenge"").At the Turnblad house, Edna is receiving calls from fans who saw Tracy on the show. A call comes in from Mr Pinky, the owner of a plus-size dress shop, for an endorsement. Tracy pleads with her mother to come with her and to act as her agent although Edna has not left their apartment in years. Finally making it outside, Edna is given a huge makeover (""Welcome to the '60s"") and Tracy becomes the spokes-girl for the shop. At school, signs of Tracy's fame are evident in the schoolyard, with graffiti on the walls and Shelly, another Council Member sporting Tracy's signature hairdo. During a game of dodge ball, a jealous Amber knocks Tracy out, and Link rushes to her side. Penny and Seaweed, who have developed a liking for each other, rush to fetch the school nurse, only to find her out sick. Seaweed, suggesting that some fun would make Tracy feel better, invites all of them to his mother's record shop for a platter party (""Run and Tell That"").At the shop, Tracy rallies everyone to march against the station on the following day's Mother-Daughter Day, as blacks are not allowed on the show except for the monthly Negro Day. Before they start, Motormouth Maybelle convinces the initially reluctant Edna and Wilbur to march as well. Link declined to participate for the sake of his contract with the show. During the protest, led by Motormouth, Velma calls the police and fights break out. When the police arrive on the scene, almost everyone is arrested (""Big, Blonde and Beautiful""). Act II After the march, most of the women are locked up in a women's penitentiary (""The Big Dollhouse""). Because of Velma's dirty tactics, the governor pardons and releases her and Amber. Wilbur bails out the remaining people, excluding Tracy who is forced to remain in jail through another one of Velma's manipulations.  Tracy is alone and wishes that Link could be with her (""Good Morning Baltimore"" (Reprise)). Back at the Har-De-Har Hut (Wilbur's joke shop), Wilbur and Edna are left destitute because of the money it cost them to bail everyone out and with Tracy still in prison. Edna sympathizes with her daughter's dream – she had dreamt of making her ""own line of queen-sized dress patterns"". Edna and Wilbur reminisce about their past and how they can never be parted from each other (""(You're) Timeless to Me"").During the night, Link sneaks into the jail where he finds Tracy in solitary confinement. As Link and Tracy reunite, Penny's mother, Prudy, punishes Penny for ""going to jail without her permission"" and ties her up in her bedroom where Seaweed comes to her rescue.  Both couples declare their love for one another (""Without Love""). After escaping from their respective prisons, the couples seek refuge at Motormouth Maybelle's Record Shop. Tracy thinks that it is unfair that after all of their hard work, The Corny Collins Show is still segregated. They devise a plan to help integrate the show, and Motormouth remembers their long fight for equality (""I Know Where I've Been"").On the day of the Miss Teenage Hairspray competition, Corny Collins starts the show with a song (""(It's) Hairspray""). Amber shows off her talents in a bid to get more votes from the viewers (""Cooties""). Just as the results are about to be announced, Tracy stuns Amber as she makes her entrance in a magenta dress without any petticoat underneath, taking over the stage, and is joined by Link, Penny, Seaweed, Edna, Wilbur, Little Inez, Corny, and Motormouth. Tracy is declared the winner of the competition. Amber and Velma protest the results, claiming that it is all wrong. Little Inez then tries to take the crown by force when Amber refuses to hand it over, but Tracy stops her, claiming that her heart is set on something more important, which is Link and her future. She then proclaims the Corny Collins show is ""now and forevermore"" racially integrated, to much applause. When all is announced, Mr. Spritzer runs onstage thrilled with the public's response to the telecast and announces that the governor has pardoned Tracy and gave her a full college scholarship and he offers Link a recording contract and Velma the position of vice president of Ultra Glow – beauty products for women of colour, much to the latter's chagrin. Prudy arrives at the station and, seeing how happy Penny is with Seaweed, accepts her daughter for who she is. At the height of the moment, the company invites Amber and Velma to join the celebration. With the station in joyous celebration, Tracy and Link cement their love with a kiss (""You Can't Stop the Beat"").","The basis of the show is the same-titled movie Hairspray of 1988, fiercely popular motion picture. The plot unfolds in the era of the 1960s, the time of bright costumes, magnificent hairstyles and pep music. At this time from scenes and radio broadcasts, jazz and blues went off almost entirely, losing own iconic popularity and new styles and fashion trends were emerging.  The action takes place in Baltimore. The TV company decides to hold a prestigious dance competition among teenagers and to choose the winners. Beautiful, fashionable, confident in themselves and their talent, they fill the studio to take part in a severe selection. They dance together, in pairs or individually, and strict jury legibly weeds out those who seem to them not very talented.  Young Tracy Turnblad follows the TV show with great interest, dreaming to get there one day, but there is one ""but"": the girl has an excessive weight. And in general, her outward appearance gives up to the other participants from wealthy families. Even her mother constantly repeats that she is not for such events. Anyway, Tracy decides that she should at least try. At first, they don’t even want to let gingerbread little girl to the studio, but give her a chance to show herself. She shows so well that is passed to the competition. And then happens what no one expected: she becomes a local star. She is recognized on the streets and asked for autographs, handsome gays make declarations of love, and school girls madly jealous her. But when comes a time when the partner is chosen for the pair dance, the girl, without hesitations, chooses the most beautiful guy, but the head of the broadcast is a racist, and he is against such a choice. Then a girl arranges a small rebellion in support of abolition of racial segregation, and that does not prevent her to get a crown of the winner of the contest."
A Chorus Line," The show opens in the middle of an audition for an upcoming Broadway production. The formidable director Zach and his assistant choreographer Larry put the dancers through their paces. Every dancer is desperate for work (""I Hope I Get It""). After the next round of cuts, 17 dancers remain. Zach tells them he is looking for a strong dancing chorus of four boys and four girls. He wants to learn more about them, and asks the dancers to introduce themselves. With reluctance, the dancers reveal their pasts. The stories generally progress chronologically from early life experiences through adulthood to the end of a career.The first candidate, Mike, explains that he is the youngest of 12 children. He recalls his first experience with dance, watching his sister's dance class when he was a pre-schooler (""I Can Do That""). Mike took her place one day when she refused to go to class—and he stayed. Bobby tries to hide the unhappiness of his childhood by making jokes. As he speaks, the other dancers have misgivings about this strange audition process and debate what they should reveal to Zach (""And...""), but since they all need the job, the session continues.Zach is angered when he feels that the streetwise Sheila is not taking the audition seriously. Opening up, she reveals that her mother married at a young age and her father neither cared about nor loved them. When she was six she realized, as had Bebe and Maggie, that ballet provided relief from her unhappy family life (""At the Ballet""). The scatterbrained Kristine is tone-deaf, and her lament that she could never sing is interrupted by her husband Al finishing her phrases in tune (""Sing"").Mark, the youngest of the dancers, relates his first experiences with pictures of the female anatomy and his first wet dream, while the other dancers share memories of adolescence (""Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love""). The 4'10"" Connie laments the problems of being short, and Diana Morales recollects her horrible high-school acting class (""Nothing""). Don remembers his first job at a nightclub and Judy reflects on her problematic childhood while some of the auditioners talk about their opinion of their parents (""Mother""). Greg speaks about his discovery of his homosexuality and Richie recounts how he nearly became a kindergarten teacher (""Gimme the Ball""). Finally, the newly-buxom Val explains that talent alone doesn't count for everything with casting directors, and silicone and plastic surgery can really help (""Dance: Ten; Looks: Three"").The dancers go downstairs to learn a song for the audition's next section, but Cassie stays onstage to talk to Zach. She is a veteran dancer who has had notable successes as a soloist. They have a history together: Zach had previously cast her in a featured part, and they had lived together for several years. Zach tells Cassie that she is too good for the chorus and shouldn't be at this audition. But she hasn't been able to find solo work and is willing to ""come home"" to the chorus where she can at least express her passion for dance (""The Music and the Mirror""). Zach sends her downstairs to learn the dance combination.Zach calls Paul, who has been reluctant to share his past, on stage for a private talk, and he emotionally relives his childhood and high-school experience, his early career in a drag act, coming to terms with his manhood and his homosexuality, and his parents' ultimate reaction to finding out about his lifestyle. Paul breaks down and is comforted by Zach. Cassie and Zach's complex relationship resurfaces during a run-through of the number created to showcase an unnamed star (""One""). Zach confronts Cassie, feeling that she is ""dancing down,"" and they rehash what went wrong in their relationship and her career. Zach points to the machine-like dancing of the rest of the cast—the other dancers who have all blended together, and who will probably never be recognized individually—and mockingly asks if this is what she wants. Cassie defiantly defends the dancers: ""I’d be proud to be one of them. They’re wonderful....They’re all special. I’d be happy to be dancing in that line. Yes, I would....""During a tap sequence, Paul falls and injures his knee that recently underwent surgery. After Paul is carried off to the hospital, all at the audition stand in disbelief, realizing that their careers can also end in an instant. Zach asks the remaining dancers what they will do when they can no longer dance. Led by Diana, they reply that whatever happens, they will be free of regret (""What I Did for Love""). The final eight dancers are selected: Mike, Cassie, Bobby, Judy, Richie, Val, Mark, and Diana.""One"" (reprise/finale) begins with an individual bow for each of the 19 characters, their hodgepodge rehearsal clothes replaced by identical spangled gold costumes. As each dancer joins the group, it is suddenly difficult to distinguish one from the other: ironically, each character who was an individual to the audience seems now to be an anonymous member of a neverending ensemble.","The play shows the selection of candidates for some kind of dance performance combining the group of 4 men and the same number of women who are selected from all present. Selector wants to hear the 17 candidates talk about themselves and their lives so they begin.  Candidates open during the auditioning differently, first expressing bewilderment and displeasure with the strange interviewing process. Some is small at height and reflects upon this occasion. Someone remembers how he started dancing young because of love to the female body, and someone replaced his sister in the dancing class, and remained in her place forever. Other found the dance escaping from the grim reality where there was no love in the family; and another was hated by her husband because she did not distinguished shades of the sound of musical instruments and dancing became her salvation.  One of the participants named Cassie was the most experience among the participants and was already familiar with the interviewer – Zach, who in the course of conversation with her said that she was too experienced for this and her place is in the solo work. But she answered him that could not be realized as a solo dancer, and therefore wanted to express hers passion for dancing at least in the group. He agrees, and all participants are sent to learn the next music number for the forthcoming phase of the audition.  One of the participants named Paul said that he was a homosexual, and all of his entourage did not accept him, constantly mocking and humiliating. He even cried on stage and Zack comforted him. Next, the audience learns that Cassie and Zach had a long relationship, which ended unsuccessfully, and they are in the process of audition and dancing reflect on the subject and on the reasons why they did not work out. He asks Cassie, if that what she wants in the future – to become indistinguishable mass of the crowd dancing in the same troupe? She does not answer directly, starting to defense the rest of the troupers, saying they all are beautiful, and each of them is amazing.  One of the dancers, Paul, hurts his knee and taken to a hospital. People remain very nervous about such a surprise and worry that their careers may end the same untraceable and they will never be able to dance. Then the final 8 dancers are selected and Cassie is among them. Once everyone is dressed in the same costumes, the dancers become truly indistinguishable from each other and each person just blend in with the ensemble crowd."
Cabaret,"  Act I At the dawn of the 1930s in Berlin, the Nazi Party is growing stronger. The Kit Kat Klub is a seedy cabaret, a place of decadent celebration. The Klub's Master of Ceremonies, or M.C. (Emcee), together with the cabaret girls and waiters, warm up the audience (""Willkommen""). In a train station, Cliff Bradshaw arrives, a young American writer coming to Berlin to work on his new novel. He meets Ernst Ludwig, a German who offers Cliff work and recommends a boarding house. At the boarding house, Fräulein Schneider offers Cliff a room for one hundred marks; he can only pay fifty. After a brief debate, she relents and lets Cliff live there for fifty marks. Fräulein Schneider observes that she has learned to take whatever life offers (""So What?"").As Cliff visits the Kit Kat Klub, the Emcee introduces a British singer, Sally, who performs a racy, flirtatious number (""Don't Tell Mama""). Afterward, she asks Cliff to recite poetry for her; he recites ""Casey at the Bat"". Cliff offers to take Sally home, but she says that her boyfriend Max, the club's owner, is too jealous. Sally performs her final number at the Kit Kat Klub aided by the female ensemble (""Mein Herr""). The cabaret ensemble performs a song and dance, calling each other on inter-table phones and inviting each other for dances and drinks (""The Telephone Song"").The next day, Cliff has just finished giving Ernst an English lesson when Sally arrives. Max has fired her and thrown her out, and now she has no place to live, and so she asks him if she can live in his room. At first he resists, but she convinces him (and Fräulein Schneider) to take her in (""Perfectly Marvelous""). The Emcee and two female companions sing a song (""Two Ladies"") that comments on Cliff and Sally's unusual living conditions. Herr Schultz, an elderly Jewish fruit-shop owner who lives in her boardinghouse, has given Fräulein Schneider a pineapple as a gift (""It Couldn't Please Me More""). In the Kit Kat Klub, a young waiter starts to sing a song—a patriotic anthem to the Fatherland that slowly descends into a darker, Nazi-inspired marching song—becoming the strident ""Tomorrow Belongs to Me"". He initially sings a cappella, before the customers and the band join in. (In the 1998 and 2014 revivals, this is replaced by the Emcee playing a recording of a boy soprano).Months later, Cliff and Sally are still living together and have fallen in love. Cliff knows that he is in a ""dream,"" but he enjoys living with Sally too much to come to his senses (""Why Should I Wake Up?""). Sally reveals that she is pregnant, but she does not know the father and reluctantly decides to get an abortion. Cliff reminds her that it could be his child, and seems to convince her to have the baby. (""Maybe This Time"") Ernst enters and offers Cliff a job—picking up a suitcase in Paris and delivering it to his ""client"" in Berlin—easy money. The Emcee comments on this with the song ""Sitting Pretty"" (or, in later versions, ""Money"").Meanwhile, Fräulein Schneider has caught one of her boarders, Fräulein Kost, bringing sailors into her room. Fräulein Schneider forbids her from doing it again, but Fräulein Kost threatens to leave. She also mentions that she has seen Fräulein Schneider with Herr Schultz in her room. Herr Schultz saves Fräulein Schneider's reputation by telling Fräulein Kost that he and Fräulein Schneider are to be married in three weeks. After Fräulein Kost leaves, Fräulein Schneider thanks Herr Schultz for lying to Fräulein Kost. Herr Schultz says that he was serious and proposes to Fräulein Schneider (""Married"").At Fräulein Schneider and Herr Schultz's engagement party, Cliff arrives and delivers the suitcase to Ernst. A tipsy Herr Schultz sings ""Meeskite"" (""meeskite"", he explains, is Yiddish for ugly or funny-looking), a song with a moral (""Anyone responsible for loveliness, large or small/Is not a meeskite at all""). Afterward, looking for revenge on Fräulein Schneider, Fräulein Kost tells Ernst, who now sports a Nazi armband, that Schultz is a Jew. Ernst warns Fräulein Schneider that marrying a Jew may not be wise. Fräulein Kost and company reprise ""Tomorrow Belongs to Me"", with more overtly Nazi overtones, as Cliff, Sally, Fräulein Schneider, Herr Schultz, and the Emcee look on. Act II The cabaret girls, along with the Emcee in drag, perform a kick line routine which eventually becomes a goose-step. Fräulein Schneider expresses her concerns about her union to Herr Schultz, who assures her that everything will be all right (""Married"" (Reprise)). They are interrupted by the crash of a brick being thrown through the window of Herr Schultz's fruit shop. Schultz tries to reassure her that it is just children making trouble, but Fräulein Schneider is afraid.Back at the Kit Kat Klub, the Emcee performs a song-and-dance routine with a girl in a gorilla suit, singing that their love has been met with universal disapproval (""If You Could See Her""). Encouraging the audience to be more open-minded, he defends his ape-woman, concluding with, ""if you could see her through my eyes... she wouldn't look Jewish at all."" (The line was intended to shock the audience and make them consider how easily and unthinkingly they accepted prejudice, but protests and boycott threats from Jewish leaders in Boston led Ebb to write an alternate final line, ""She isn't a Meeskite at all."") Fräulein Schneider goes to Cliff and Sally's room and returns their engagement present, explaining that her marriage has been called off. When Cliff protests, saying that she can't just give up this way, she asks him what other choice she has (""What Would You Do?"").Cliff tells Sally that he is taking her back to America so that they can raise their baby together. Sally protests, declaring how wonderful their life in Berlin is, and Cliff sharply tells her to ""wake up"" and take notice of the growing unrest around them. Sally retorts that politics have nothing to do with them or their affairs. Following their argument, Sally returns to the club (""I Don't Care Much"") (in the 1998 Broadway and 2012 London revivals, Sally takes cocaine before leaving Cliff's room). At the Kit Kat Klub after another heated argument with Sally, Cliff is accosted by Ernst, who has another delivery job for him. Cliff tries to brush him off, but when Ernst asks if Cliff's attitude towards him is because of ""that Jew at the party"", Cliff attacks him—only to be badly beaten up by Ernst's Nazi bodyguards and dragged out of the club.  On stage, the Emcee introduces Sally, who enters to perform again, singing that ""life is a cabaret, old chum,"" cementing her decision to live in carefree ignorance and freedom (""Cabaret"").The next morning, the bruised Cliff is packing, when Herr Schultz visits. He tells Cliff that he is moving to another boardinghouse, but is confident that the bad times will soon pass. He understands the German people, he says, because he is a German too. When Sally returns, she reveals that she has had an abortion; Cliff slaps her. He still hopes that she will join him, but Sally says that she has ""always hated Paris"" and hopes that when Cliff finally writes his novel, he will dedicate it to her. Cliff leaves, heartbroken.On the train to Paris, Cliff begins to write his novel, reflecting on his experiences: ""There was a cabaret, and there was a master of ceremonies ... and there was a city called Berlin, in a country called Germany ... and it was the end of the world."" (""Willkommen"" Reprise). In the Kit Kat Klub, the Emcee welcomes us (in the 1998 revival, he strips off his overcoat to reveal a concentration camp prisoner's uniform marked with a yellow Star of David and a pink triangle), and the backdrop raises to reveal white space with the ensemble standing within. The cabaret ensemble reprises ""Willkommen"", but it is now harsh and violent as the Emcee sings, ""Auf Wiedersehen...à bientôt..."" followed by a crescendo drum roll and a cymbal crash.  Some productions have the white space then flashing with a strobe effect, implying the cabaret performers, except for Sally (who is not standing in the white space), will fall victim to Nazi atrocities towards the Jews and gays.","Events unfold against the backdrop of the 1930s in Germany, which slowly becomes a Nazi. Not yet completely succumbed to the war’s fever, but many notes are already heard. Young English-language writer arrives in Germany, Berlin, to create there his new novel. He met the prioress of the guesthouse, which accepts him to settle into the room for 50 Reichsmarks, although initially planned to take 100 out of him, but he could not pay so much, so she accepted, following the wise rule of ""better 10 times of one than 10 times of nothing"".  The new guest visits the nearby club, cabaret that experience its decadent times and is now dilapidated. One of the dancers, with whom he that evening having physical romance, planning to take her home, does not agree to do it, under the guise of a guy who is the owner of this establishment. The next day, however, she had to ask him to live along with him, because the owner of the club fired her and now she has nowhere to go. He reluctantly accepts her, although such co-existence seems strange to him.  The owner of the hotel accuses one of the guests that she accepts in her room different sailors. She wants to ban these people visiting her room, but latter is threatened to move out and the owner will not be earning from this room. And in general she said that the owner of the hotel was visited by the local Jewish – owner of the fruit shop, that went into her room. But he heard the conversation and said that he is the groom, and therefore has the right to and they are about to marry in 3 weeks. Not originally planned to speak so, he comes to making an offer to the owner of the hotel and she accepts it. Once, at a party on the occasion of their engagement, a hoocker, angry at the owner, says to one German, that owner is going to marry a Jew, and he informs the owner that marriage to a Hebrew now is not the best solution.  The writer wants to marry the pregnant girl and to go to America, but she loves Berlin and did not want to leave. Then she makes an abortion, and he hits her in the face. After she returned to sing in a cabaret, where she took over it all, singing 'life is a cabaret, old chum', declaring a desire to live in luxury and neglecting her surrounding world, which is constantly growing with concern.  One of the visitors of the club, Nazi beats our writer and he packs his belongings and went to Paris, starting writing his novel on the road, which he had not started in Berlin. The owner of the hotel breaks her engagement with the Hebrew – the owner of the store, because fears for their future together and for themselves. He moves out of it in a different inn.  In the last scene is portrayed as the actors go to the gas chamber and gas starts."
Little Shop of Horrors,"  Act I An offstage voice recalls a time when the human race ""suddenly encountered a deadly threat to its very existence"". A trio of 1960s street urchins named Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon set the scene (""Little Shop of Horrors"") and comment on the action throughout the show. Seymour Krelborn is a poor young man, an orphan living in an urban skid row. Audrey is a pretty blonde with a fashion sense that leans towards the tacky. They lament their stations in life and the urban blight in their neighborhood (""Skid Row (Downtown)""). They are co-workers at Mushnik's Skid Row Florists, a run-down flower shop owned and operated by the cranky Mr. Mushnik. Seymour has recently obtained a mysterious plant that looks like a large venus flytrap. While he was browsing the wholesale flower district, a sudden eclipse of the sun occurred, and when the light returned, the weird plant had appeared (""Da-Doo""). Seymour, who is secretly in love with Audrey, names the plant Audrey II in her honor.The plant does not thrive in its new environment and appears to be dying. Seymour questions why it should be doing poorly, since he takes such good care of it. He accidentally pricks his finger on a rose thorn, which draws blood, and Audrey II's pod opens thirstily. Seymour realizes that Audrey II requires blood to survive and allows the plant to suckle from his finger (""Grow For Me""). As Audrey II grows, it becomes an attraction and starts generating brisk business for Mushnik. As the caretaker of the plant, the timid Seymour is suddenly regarded as a hero (""Ya Never Know""), while Audrey secretly longs to leave her abusive boyfriend. Her dream is to lead an ideal suburban life with Seymour, complete with a tract home, frozen dinners, and plastic on the furniture (""Somewhere That's Green"").Meanwhile, the employees at Mushnik's are sprucing up the flower shop because of the popularity of the rapidly growing Audrey II and the revenue that it is bringing in (""Closed for Renovation""). Orin Scrivello, a sadistic dentist, is Audrey's abusive boyfriend. Modeled after the ""Leader of the pack"" characters of the 1950s, Orin drives a motorcycle, wears leather, and enjoys bringing other people pain (""Dentist!""). Orin encourages Seymour to take the plant and get out of Skid Row. Realizing that his store's sudden profitability is completely dependent on the plant (and therefore on Seymour), Mushnik takes advantage of Seymour's innocence by offering to adopt him and make him a full partner in the business. Having always wanted a family, Seymour accepts, even though Mushnik has always yelled at him and treated him poorly (""Mushnik and Son""). However, Seymour is having difficulty providing enough blood to keep Audrey II healthy. When Seymour stops feeding the plant, Audrey II reveals that it can speak. It demands blood and promises that, if fed, it will make sure that all of Seymour's dreams come true. Seymour initially refuses, but he then witnesses Orin abusing Audrey. The plant presents this as a justification for killing Orin. Not realizing that he is being manipulated again, Seymour gives in to his baser instincts and agrees (""Feed Me (Git It)""). He sets up a late-night appointment with Orin, intending to kill him. However, Seymour loses his nerve and decides not to commit the crime. Unfortunately for Orin, who is getting high on nitrous oxide, the gas device is stuck in the ""on"" position, and he overdoses while asking Seymour to save him. Seymour cannot bring himself to shoot Orin but lets him die of asphyxiation (""Now (It's Just The Gas)""). Seymour feeds Orin's body to the now huge Audrey II, and the plant consumes it with ravenous glee (""Act I Finale""). Act II The flower shop is much busier, and Seymour and Audrey have trouble keeping up with the onslaught of orders (""Call Back in the Morning""). Audrey confides to Seymour that she feels guilty about Orin's disappearance, because she secretly wished it. The two admit their feelings for one another, and Seymour promises that he will protect and care for Audrey from now on (""Suddenly, Seymour""). The two plan to leave together and start a new life, although Seymour mistakenly attributes Audrey's feelings to his newfound fame, not realizing that she loved him even before he found the plant.Before they can go, Mushnik confronts Seymour about Orin's death. Mushnik has put two and two together: the bloody dentist's uniform, the drops of blood on the floor, and he has seen Seymour and Audrey kissing. Seymour denies killing Orin, but Mushnik wants him to give a statement to the police, who have begun investigating. Audrey II tells Seymour that he has to be rid of Mushnik or he will lose everything, including Audrey (""Suppertime""). Seymour tells Mushnik that he put the days' receipts inside Audrey II for safekeeping. Mushnik climbs inside the plant's gaping maw to search for the money, realizing the deception too late, and screams as he is devoured. Seymour now runs the flower shop, and reporters, salesmen, lawyers and agents approach him, promising him fame and fortune. Although tempted by the trappings of his success, Seymour realizes that it is only a matter of time before Audrey II will kill again and that he is morally responsible. He considers destroying the plant but believing that his fame is the only thing that is earning him Audrey's love, he is unable to do so (""The Meek Shall Inherit"").As Seymour works on his speech for a lecture tour, Audrey II again squalls for blood.  Seymour threatens to kill it just as Audrey walks in asking when Mushnik will return from visiting his ""sick sister"". Seymour learns that Audrey would still love him without the fame and decides that Audrey II must die after the scheduled LIFE magazine interview at the shop. Audrey is confused and frightened by Seymour's ramblings, but she runs home by his order.  That night, unable to sleep and distressed by Seymour's strange behavior, Audrey goes to the flower shop to talk with him.  He is not there, and Audrey II begs her to water him. Not sensing the mortal danger, she approaches to water it, and a vine wraps around her and pulls her into the plant's gaping maw (""Sominex/Suppertime II""). Seymour arrives and attacks the plant in an attempt to save Audrey. He pulls her out, but Audrey is mortally wounded.  Her dying wish is for Seymour to feed her to the plant after she dies so that they can always be together. She dies in his arms, and he reluctantly honors her request (""Somewhere That's Green"" (reprise)). Seymour falls asleep as Audrey II grows small red flower buds.The next day, Patrick Martin from the World Botanical Enterprises tells Seymour that his company wishes to take leaf cuttings of Audrey II and sell them across America. Seymour realizes the plant's evil plan: during the solar eclipse, Audrey II came from an unknown planet to conquer Earth. He tries shooting, cutting, and poisoning the plant, but it has grown too hardy to kill.  Seymour, in desperation, runs into its open jaws with a machete planning to kill it from the inside, but he is quickly eaten. Patrick, Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon search for Seymour. Not finding him, Patrick tells the girls to take the cuttings.Crystal, Ronette, and Chiffon relate that, following these events, other plants appeared across America, tricking innocent people into feeding them blood in exchange for fame and fortune. Out of the fog, Audrey II, bigger than ever, appears with opened new flowers revealing the faces of Seymour, Audrey, Mushnik and Orin, who beg that, no matter how persuasive the plants may be, they must not be fed (""Finale Ultimo: Don't Feed the Plants""). Audrey II slithers towards the audience threateningly (In the original Off-Broadway production, plant tendrils fell all over the audience, as if each audience member were to be pulled into the plant, while in the Broadway production, a monstrously huge Audrey II was projected out over the fifth row and the balcony seats, as if it would eat the audience members).","The main character of the musical Seymour is an orphan. He worked as a florist in a rundown flower shop of Mr. Mushnik. His colleague was a sweet girl named Audrey. Soon Seymour gained unusual plant, like a huge flycatcher. It appeared out of nowhere after a solar eclipse. The young man gave the name to the flower after his colleague, because he was secretly in love with her. Once Seymour noticed that plant was fading. Accidentally he found out that it feeds with human blood, so the young man began to feed Audrey 2. After receiving the food, the plant began to increase in size. Soon it attracted people's attention. More customers began visiting the store and business of Mr. Mushnik went better. Seymour dreamed that one day Audrey will abandon former boyfriend and will confess her love to him. The young man often imagined how they would live happily in their own house.  Due to the increased popularity of the shop, owner decided to upgrade its interior. All employees of Mr. Mushnik came to make repairs. Soon Orin came – boyfriend of Audrey. He worked as a dentist and liked to make people suffer. Seeing Seymour, boyfriend told him to take his plant & to get out of this place. The owner did not want the store left without its main attraction, so he solved this problem by adopting the boy and made him his partner. Realizing that he could not feed Audrey 2 enough, Seymour stopped giving blood to plant at all. Left without food, it began to speak and promised to fulfill any dream of florist in exchange for food. At first, the boy refused to give in to herb. But after seeing how badly Orin treats to a woman, he has changed his mind. The plant prompted him to do so, saying that only Seymour can save Audrey from flouting. A young man settled an appointment with dentist. Florist could not shoot Orin, but did not save him when he began to suffocate due to nitrous oxide. Soon the young man fed the body of the deceased man to his plant.  After the disappearance of Orin, girl confessed Seymour in love. Mr. Mushnik compared the disappearance of dentist, drops of blood on the floor of the store and kissing florists. Soon the owner asked Seymour what he knows about the Orin. Realizing that it was in danger, the plant convinced the boy to kill Mr. Mushnik. Seymour tricked him to get close to Audrey 2 and so a predator ate another man.  Soon, the plant has attracted media attention. Recognizing the threat from the dangerous creature, Seymour decided to kill Audrey 2. The young man was worrying very much that girl saw this. The young man asked her to go home. Audrey stayed there for a short time – she was anxious too much for Seymour.  Back at the store, she did not find the boy there. Seeing the prey upfront of him, the plant asked Audrey to pour it. Soon predatory flower attacked the girl. Appeared Seymour pulled Audrey away from the plant, but she died of wounds. Before her death, the girl asked the boy to give her body to the plant. She already guessed where Orin, and Mr. Mushnik gone. Overpowering himself, Seymour performed the last will of his beloved.  The next day a man of WBE came to the shop – they wanted to get a new plant’s cuttings. Not finding Seymour, he took Audrey’s 2 material for planting. Florist at that time was no longer alive. He tried to destroy the plant and became its prey. Alien monster began to implement its plan to take over the Earth."
Grease," (Because of changes to the musical that have been made since the 1978 film, several variants exist. In the event two songs are listed at any given point, the first is from the 1972 Off-Broadway version, and the second is from revivals that use the film music, such as the 2007 version.) Act I In revivals that use the 1978 song ""Grease,"" it is typically inserted at or near the beginning of the show.At the Rydell High Class of 1959 reunion (""Alma Mater""), old maid English teacher, Miss Lynch, introduces former cheerleader/yearbook-editor Patty Simcox Honeywell and class valedictorian Eugene Florczyk. Eugene gives a rousing speech, mentioning that the alumni who are missing from the reunion are surely present in-spirit. The scene segues to bring in the greaser gang known as the Burger Palace Boys (known in later versions as the ""T-Birds"") and their auxiliary, the ""Pink Ladies"", as they sing a cruder version of the Rydell alma mater (""Alma Mater (Parody)""). Flashing back to the first day of high school in fall 1958, the Pink Ladies sit in the lunchroom, and the Burger Palace Boys sit at the entrance to the school. One of the Pink Ladies, Frenchy, introduces her new neighbor Sandy Dumbrowski, who had been unjustly rejected from a Catholic school, to the others (Marty, Jan and Rizzo), as well as Patty. Sandy tells of how she had a brief love affair the summer before, which ended with unresolved love. Meanwhile, womanizing greaser Danny Zuko is telling the Burger Palace Boys (Kenickie, Roger, Doody and Sonny) the story of his own summer fling (""Summer Nights""). The Pink Ladies soon after realize that Sandy's summer fling was the same Danny Zuko that attends Rydell High and arrange for the two to bump into each other at school; the resulting meeting is tense and awkward, as Danny had previously told Sandy that he attended a private academy and does not want to admit to the Burger Palace Boys that she was the woman he was talking about. As the Burger Palace Boys leave, Sandy is heartbroken, but the Pink Ladies cheer her up, by inviting her over to Marty's pajama party. Shortly afterwards, the teenagers gather in the hall as Doody shows off his new guitar and performs a song (""Those Magic Changes"").At Marty's pajama party, the girls experiment with wine, cigarettes, and pierced ears; and talk about boys. The sheltered Sandy goes into shock from seeing blood when the Pink Ladies try to pierce her ears, leading them to mock her when she's not in the room (in some revivals, the song ""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" is placed here, mirroring the film). Marty tells about her long-distance courtship with a Marine named Freddy, which is implied she only maintains because of the lavish gifts he sends her from Japan (""Freddy, My Love""). That same night, the Burger Palace Boys are busy stealing hubcaps, unaware that the hubcaps are on Kenickie's car, Greased Lightnin'. Unfazed by the others' skepticism, Kenickie sings of the upgrades needed to make the car a racing-worthy chick magnet (""Greased Lightnin'"").Danny sees Sandy again at her cheerleader practice, and tries to apologize for his behavior. Patty interrupts and flirts with Danny. Patty informs Danny that track try-outs are nearing, and Danny tells Sandy that he will join the track team to prove himself; he leaves as Patty and Sandy practice cheering (""Rydell Fight Song"").As the Burger Palace Boys and Pink Ladies gather at the park, Danny reveals to the rest of the greasers that he has joined the track team, much to their dismay and skepticism. After Roger and Jan bicker about food, drink and religion, she asks him how he earned the nickname Rump; he explains that, as ""King of the Mooners,"" he has a hobby of baring his backside to unsuspecting victims, and in the process, both reveal their affections for each other (""Mooning""). Rizzo teases Danny for falling for a girl who resembles the excessively proper teenage ingénue, Sandra Dee, and the other greasers join in as she makes fun of Sandy, who has not arrived to the picnic yet (""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"").Sandy, working on a biology assignment with Eugene, comes in just as the greasers finish making fun of her. She attacks Rizzo in a fit of rage and erroneously assumes Danny is the one behind the mockery. Furious, she tells Danny that she wishes she never met him and storms out of the picnic. Danny shrugs off Sandy's negative response, and the greasers pair off for the upcoming sock hop. Danny teases Marty for not having a date (recommending Eugene), and the greasers all laugh (""We Go Together"").For revivals that use ""Hopelessly Devoted to You,"" the exact placement varies. It sometimes replaces the first rendition of ""We Go Together"" and in other examples, such as the 2007 revival, it is placed early in Act II. Act II The night of the sock hop arrives (""Shakin' At the High School Hop""). Sandy is at home by herself, listening to the radio and crying over how much she misses Danny (""It's Raining on Prom Night"").Meanwhile, Kenickie comes into the dance with his date, Cha-Cha DiGregorio, a beastly girl from Saint Bernadette's Academy. Patty tries to pair up with Danny, trash-talking Sandy's cheerleading skills in the process, but is unable to get out of her promise to dance with Eugene despite Rizzo trying to seduce Eugene as a distraction. Kenickie ends up paired off with Rizzo, and Danny with Cha-Cha. The MC Vince Fontaine, a radio disc jockey, begins the hand jive dance contest, and everyone eagerly participates as he tags the contestants out (""Born to Hand Jive""). In the end, Danny and Cha-Cha are the winners. Amongst the awards given to the couple, Danny receives two free drive-in movie tickets.Sometime later outside of the Burger Palace hangout, Kenickie, Doody, and Sonny run into Frenchy. The boys are armed with an ""arsenal"" of household items and reveal that, to their surprise, Cha-Cha was the girlfriend of someone in the boys' rival gang, the Flaming Dukes; the Dukes, hearing of Cha-Cha's dancing with the Burger Palace Boys, challenged the boys to a rumble. Danny sprints into the scene wearing his track suit, to the disbelief of the other boys. Danny tells the boys he cannot partake in the rumble because of a track meet and sprints off.The three remaining boys go into the Burger Palace for a snack before the fight, and Frenchy laments at what to do with her life, having dropped out of beauty school in frustration at failing all of her classes. The heavenly Teen Angel appears with a chorus of back-up singing angels and tells her to return to high school (""Beauty School Dropout"").The three boys exit the Burger Palace, bemoaning Danny's betrayal while only halfheartedly noticing Roger is unaccounted for. They wait for the Flaming Dukes, but the rival gang never turns up. Roger finally turns up with only a broken antenna as a weapon; in response, the other three proceed to strip Roger of his pants and shoes.At the drive-in, Danny tries to make up for his behavior and offers Sandy his class ring. She initially is thrilled, but pulls back and exits the car when he tries to move beyond a kiss. Danny laments his loneliness (""Alone at a Drive-In Movie"" or ""Sandy"").Several days later, Sandy and the greasers — without Danny — are gathered in Jan's basement (""Rock 'N' Roll Party Queen""). Rizzo, who missed her period, fears she is pregnant and tells Marty (who herself laments that Vince tried to spike her drink at the dance) that the father is a stranger who had sex with her with a cheap, broken condom; word gets back to everyone else. The boys offer support as they leave; Rizzo rejects it, which leads Sandy to ask her why and concludes that Kenickie is the presumed father. Rizzo responds by saying that she is a better person than others make her out to be and that showing weakness is the worst thing she knows (""There Are Worse Things I Could Do""). Rizzo leaves, and Sandy decides what she needs to do to fit in with the greasers (""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee"" (Reprise)).The next day, the boys are hanging out at the Burger Palace. A dejected Patty reveals Danny, who follows her in, has reverted to his old ways and quit the track team. Sandy comes in alongside the Pink Ladies, having transformed herself from an innocent schoolgirl into a greaser's fantasy, punching out a dismayed Patty. Danny is delighted at this change and the couple express their mutual feelings for each other (""All Choked Up"" or ""You're the One That I Want"").Afterwards, the greasers prepare to head to Roger's to watch The Mickey Mouse Club, inviting Patty along. Frenchy takes a job as a makeup saleswoman at Woolworth's, Rizzo reveals that she is not pregnant, and she and Kenickie reunite. All ends happily, and the Burger Palace Boys, the Pink Ladies, Sandy, and Patty sing about how they will always be friends to the end (""We Go Together"" (Reprise)). Revival changes Due to the popularity of the 1978 film adaptation, which made several changes to the musical's songs and themes (many to accommodate its casting choice for singer Olivia Newton-John as Sandy), the subsequent revivals adopted several of the changes made in the film, particularly the replacement of several songs, and the renaming of the Burger Palace Boys to their film name, the T-Birds. However, in the revival, the role of Sandy Dumbrowski is not changed from the original Broadway production. School Version In order to make the original musical suitable for young performers and audiences, Jim Jacobs decided to write a ""School Version"" of the musical. This edition eliminates all of the references to cigarettes and alcohol, and also any swearing or bad language. Most of the songs have also undergone changes as well; the numbers are all shortened greatly and edited for content/language. Some plot lines are missing from the school version, such as Rizzo's pregnancy and her song ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do"" and “Hopelessly Devoted”. This section is entirely cut from the script and score. The beginning of the pajama party in Marty's bedroom is also cut. (In this version, the Pink Ladies do not offer Sandy cigarettes or wine. Instead it begins directly with piercing her ears.) Overall, this version is considered to be G-rated.In addition to the removal of ""There Are Worse Things I Could Do,"" and Hopelessly Devoted, the following songs of the School Version have undergone lyric changes:""Alma Mater Parody""""Summer Nights""""Freddy, My Love""""Greased Lightnin'""""Look at Me, I'm Sandra Dee""""Beauty School Dropout""The remainder of the songs have been greatly edited for time, deleting several verses from the original songs.A version of the play is available that keeps some of the adult references and innuendo but excises some of the more explicit lyrics.", 
Newsies," Act IIn the early hours of the morning in 1899 New York City, newsboy Jack Kelly tells his friend with a disabled leg, Crutchie, of his dream to one day leave New York for Santa Fe (""Santa Fe"" (Prologue)). Jack lives with his fellow ""newsies,"" many of whom are orphaned and homeless. As the sun rises, the newsies awaken and prepare for another day on the job (""Carrying the Banner""). While buying their supply of papers to sell, Jack meets Davey and his little brother, Les. Unlike the rest of the newsies, Davey and Les have a home and a family. They started work as newsies because their father suffered an accident at work resulting in the termination of his employment. Seeing young Les as an opportunity to sell more papers, Jack offers to help the boys. Meanwhile, the publisher of the New York World, Joseph Pulitzer, increases the cost of the newspapers to the delivery boys, so as to outsell his competitors (""The Bottom Line"").Later, Jack, Davey, and Les are chased down by the corrupt Warden Snyder of The Refuge, a juvenile detention center. The boys find cover in a vaudeville-style theatre owned by Jack's friend Medda Larkin, whom he regularly paints backdrops for. Jack refuses to tell Davey why Snyder was after him. The boys then watch Medda perform (""That's Rich""). While at the show, Jack spots a young female reporter named Katherine Plumber. He attempts to flirt with her, but she brushes him off as he does a drawing of her. Jack laments his blossoming feelings for her as the show continues (""Don’t Come A-Knocking""/""I Never Planned on You""). The next morning, Jack and the newsies discover that the cost of newspapers has been raised to sixty cents per hundred. Outraged, Jack organizes a protest (""The World Will Know""). Katherine is inspired by Jack's leadership and artistic abilities, and sees the newsies' strike as an opportunity to be seen as a more serious journalist, something she struggles with because of society's view of women, and decides to cover the protest. (""Watch What Happens"") The next day, Jack fails to properly motivate the Newsies, as he isn't always the best with words, but Davey steps in and rallies the newsies for a full scale strike against the New York World (""Seize the Day""). The protest is cut short when the boys are engaged in confrontations with the police and strikebreakers. During the commotion, Crutchie is beaten, apprehended, and taken to the refuge. Jack, upset at the protest's failure and the capture of Crutchie, laments the situation and promises himself that he'll soon leave New York forever (""Santa Fe (reprise)"").Act IIThe next morning, Katherine visits the sulking newsies in Jacobi's Deli and cheers them up by showing them that her article about the strike made the front page of the New York Sun. Thrilled, the newsies all rejoice at making the headline and imagine what it would be like to be famous (""King of New York""). Meanwhile, Crutchie writes a letter to Jack, reflecting his experience at the Refuge (""Letter from the Refuge""). Davey, Katherine, and Les later find Jack hiding out in the basement of Medda's theatre, painting a backdrop of Santa Fe. Davey and Katherine attempt to decide their next move, but Jack refuses to put the newsies in danger again. Davey reminds him that they'll have to take risks in order to get Crutchie back, and that quitting won't help anybody. Jack eventually complies (""Watch What Happens"" (reprise)).Back at the World, Pulitzer converses with Warden Snyder about Jack while Katherine listens in secret. Snyder reveals that Jack is actually an escaped criminal, originally detained for stealing food and clothing. Jack soon arrives and confronts Pulitzer. During the conversation, Pulitzer reveals that he is actually Katherine's father. Katherine, who was hiding in the room, tries to apologize to Jack for not telling him, but Jack brushes her off as he is led by Snyder into the cellar. Pulitzer offers Jack a compromise: if the strike is called off, he will be cleared of all charges and given enough money to leave for Santa Fe, but if not, he and the other newsies will be sent to the refuge (""The Bottom Line"" (reprise)). Meanwhile, Spot Conlon, head of the newsies in Brooklyn, brings in his ranks in full support of Jack's protest (""Brooklyn's Here""). The newsies use Medda's theater as a meeting place, and Jack, not wanting to put them in any more danger, reluctantly suggests they accept Pulitzer's offer. Davey and the newsies are shocked and angry at Jack for turning his head from the strike. Jack later finds Katherine on his rooftop, and she tells him that despite her namesake, she was always on Jack's side. She sees the drawings Jack made depicting the abuse conducted at the refuge, and she realizes Jack stole the food and clothing for the other boys there. The two share a romantic moment and song, and Katherine sings ""I have something to believe in, now that I know you believed in me"". Jack admits that the feeling is mutual, and they kiss (""Something to Believe In""). Katherine tells Jack about an idea she has to get the strike back on track... She suggests printing a paper that calls for all of the children and workers of New York to strike alongside the newsies. Motivated once again, the newsies join Jack and Katherine in printing their own paper; one that will determine the outcome of the strike (""Once and for All""). They utilize an abandoned printing press in the cellar of Pulitzer's office. The newsies' paper is then sent to Governor Theodore Roosevelt, who arrives in full support of the newsies' cause, due partly to his rocky past with Pulitzer. Roosevelt gives Pulitzer an ultimatum, and he has no choice but to compromise if he wants to stay in business. Defeated, Pulitzer compromises with Jack once more. Jack proposes that Pulitzer buy back every paper the newsies fail to sell every day, thus making him seem more generous and making more boys want to sell papers for him. Pulitzer is reluctant at first, but agrees.  Crutchie is freed from the refuge, Snyder is arrested, the refuge is shut down, and the strike ends. Pulitzer offers Jack a job as a daily political cartoonist, which Jack initially declines. Jack prepares to say goodbye to Katherine and the newsies, as he now plans to leave for Santa Fe, but Katherine says that wherever he goes she will go with him. The two share a kiss, and Jack decides to remain a newsboy and accept the cartoonist job (""Finale"").","1889. Jack told to his acquainted with a disability Crutchie about own dream to visit Santa Fe. The boy lived with his friends, newspapermen. Many of them were homeless orphans. They started working in the early morning. By purchasing the newspaper for sale, Jack met Davey & his little brother Les. The boys began to be newspapermen to help their father – there was an accident, after which the man was fired. Realizing that young age can help Les to sell newspapers, Jack offered help to brothers.  Publisher Joseph Pulitzer decided to increase the cost of printed materials, purchased by distributors. When they began to sell newspapers, they have been discovered & began to be pursued by the warden from the center for young offenders. Comrades have found shelter in the Medda Larkin theater. She was a friend of Jack – the young man drew for her backdrops of decorations. There a newspaperman noted journalist Katherine. He wanted to flirt with her, but she ignored his efforts.  On the morning, teenagers found out that the cost of 100 newspapers increased by 10 cents. They rebelled & began to strike. Their leader became Jack. This was watched by Katherine. She decided to write an article about the protests. Soon, the young man could not motivate the newsmen any longer, but with the help of Davey he managed to find the right words to continue. They called on comrades to prevent the sales of Pulitzer’s publishing. The strike ended when adolescents were confronted by police & strikebreakers. In the dispersal of protesters, they captured Crutchie. Jack could not afford to forgive it to himself. Katherine in morning showed strikers a newspaper article about their performances. Girl with Davey & Les found hiding Jack. He was painting the theater’s backdrop of Santa Fe. Davey & Katherine decided what the next step of the strikers would be. Jack refused to take part in it. Davey reminded him of Crutchie – to save him they had to take the risk. Eventually, Jack agreed.  Publisher & the warden of the Center were talking about the leader of the strikers. They have been overheard by Katherine. She learned that the young man had been arrested for theft. Soon he ran out of the center for young offenders. Jack came to the newspaper – he confronted to Joseph Pulitzer. During the conversation, it became clear that the tycoon was the father of Katherine. She tried to apologize to Jack because of her reticence, but he just got mad at her. Pulitzer offered the young man a compromise – he will stop the strike & in return the charges will be removed & he will be given with money to move to Santa Fe. Otherwise, he will be placed back into the center for young criminals. When Jack told his comrades that they should accept the proposal of tycoon, they were shocked. Later, the young man met with Katherine. Having criticized Jack, she noticed the drawings, which depicted violence prevailing in the center for young offenders. She realized that the young man stole food & clothing to help these boys. Katherine admitted Jack in love. It turned out that their feelings were mutual. Katherine, Jack & other adolescents have organized their own publication. Newspaper of distributors came to the Governor Theodore Roosevelt, who supported their demands.  Mogul decided to compromise with Jack. The young man offered Pulitzer to buy out newspapers that were not sold during the day by distributors. Published hardly walked this step. Soon Crutchie was released. Center’s warden was arrested. Pulitzer offered Jack to work at him as political cartoonist, but at first, Jack refused. Learning that the young man wanted to go to Santa Fe, Katherine decided to go with him. After that, Jack took the publisher's offer & stayed with a girl in New York."
My Fair Lady,"  Act I In Edwardian London, Eliza Doolittle is a Cockney flower girl with a thick, unintelligible accent. The noted phonetician Professor Henry Higgins encounters Eliza at Covent Garden and laments the vulgarity of her dialect (""Why Can't the English?""). Higgins also meets Colonel Pickering, another linguist, and invites him to stay as his houseguest. Eliza and her friends wonder what it would be like to live a comfortable life (""Wouldn't It Be Loverly?"").Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, stops by the next morning searching for money for a drink (""With a Little Bit of Luck""). Soon after, Eliza comes to Higgins's house, seeking elocution lessons so that she can get a job as an assistant in a florist's shop. Higgins wagers Pickering that, within six months, by teaching Eliza to speak properly, he will enable her to pass for a proper lady.Eliza becomes part of Higgins's household. Though Higgins sees himself as a kindhearted man who merely cannot get along with women (""I'm an Ordinary Man""), to others he appears self-absorbed and misogynistic. Eliza endures Higgins's tyrannical speech tutoring. Frustrated, she dreams of different ways to kill him (""Just You Wait""). Higgins's servants lament the stressful atmosphere (""The Servants' Chorus""). Just as Higgins is about to give up on her, Eliza suddenly recites one of her diction exercises in perfect upper-class style (""The Rain in Spain""). Though Mrs Pearce, the housekeeper, insists that Eliza go to bed, she declares she is too excited to sleep (""I Could Have Danced All Night"").For her first public tryout, Higgins takes Eliza to his mother's box at Ascot Racecourse (""Ascot Gavotte""). Though Eliza shocks everyone when she forgets herself while watching a race and reverts to foul language, she does capture the heart of Freddy Eynsford-Hill. Freddy calls on Eliza that evening, and he declares that he will wait for her in the street outside Higgins' house (""On the Street Where You Live"").Eliza's final test requires her to pass as a lady at the Embassy Ball. After more weeks of preparation, she is ready. All the ladies and gentlemen at the ball admire her, and the Queen of Transylvania invites her to dance with the prince (""Embassy Waltz""). A Hungarian phonetician, Zoltan Karpathy, attempts to discover Eliza's origins. Higgins allows Karpathy to dance with Eliza. Act II The ball is a success; Karpathy has declared Eliza to be a Hungarian princess. Pickering and Higgins revel in their triumph (""You Did It""), failing to pay attention to Eliza. Eliza is insulted at receiving no credit for her success, packing up and leaving the Higgins house. As she leaves she finds Freddy, who begins to tell her how much he loves her, but she tells him that she has heard enough words; if he really loves her, he should show it (""Show Me""). Eliza and Freddy return to Covent Garden but she finds she no longer feels at home there. Her father is there as well, and he tells her that he has received a surprise bequest from an American millionaire, which has raised him to middle-class respectability, and now must marry his lover. Doolittle and his friends have one last spree before the wedding (""Get Me to the Church on Time"").Higgins awakens the next morning. He finds himself out of sorts without Eliza. He wonders why she left after the triumph at the ball and concludes that men (especially himself) are far superior to women (""A Hymn to Him""). Pickering notices the Professor's lack of consideration, and also leaves the Higgins house.Higgins despondently visits his mother's house, where he finds Eliza. Eliza declares she no longer needs Higgins (""Without You""). As Higgins walks home, he realizes he's grown attached to Eliza (""I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face""). At home, he sentimentally reviews the recording he made the day Eliza first came to him for lessons, hearing his own harsh words. Eliza suddenly appears in his home. In suppressed joy at their reunion, Professor Higgins scoffs and asks, ""Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?""","Two men have been waiting for their cabs at rainy night. Eliza Doolittle was selling flowers on the street under this rain. She came from the lower strata of society, which was clearly audible in her voice. A passing-by man splashed mud on her violets, and the saleswoman answered with vituperation. Eliza calmed down only when an elderly gentleman bought from her a bouquet. Suddenly she heard rudeness – another man addressed to her, using her own style of speech. Explaining that he is studying phonetics, the gentleman began to complain about the horrible slang of flowers-seller. He said that could in 6 months transform Eliza into a lady, teaching her the correct pronunciation. An elderly gentleman introduced himself. His name was Colonel Pickering – he studied Indian dialects. The fond in phonetics man named himself as Mr. Higgins. Both of them had heard about each other, so were glad to meet. Professor Higgins invited the colonel to stay in his house.  When they were discussing vowels, the housekeeper entered. She said that the woman came with a terrible accent to the owner. It was Eliza. Flower person wanted to take pronunciation lessons to get a job in a florist shop. Pickering made a bet with Higgins – he pays for classes, and the man prepares a woman for visit of the embassy’s ball, where no one had to guess about the origin of Eliza. Agreed, Professor entrusted care of the flower girl to his housekeeper. In the morning, Eliza's father went to Higgins. He said that living next to a man threatens the honor of his daughter. The professor was shocked by the lack of moral principles in her father – after receiving 5 pounds, he allowed his daughter to stay in someone else's house. Higgins flippantly recommended this man to American millionaire, who was looking for an object of lectures on moral principles.  Education was not happy for Eliza – she was tired of repeating phrases that were supposed to make her speech better. But soon she was able to pronounce one sentence perfectly. All were very happy about this. After a while, Eliza had perfect pronunciation. The first coming out was decided to carry out on the hippodrome. Higgins persuaded the mother to take the girl in her seat and to talk to her about the weather and the health of others. Speaking in slang, Eliza spoiled the positive impression made on visitors of the races. But she managed to win the heart of Freddy – the young man wanted to meet with a girl, but the flower girl did not want to communicate with him – it was him who splashed mud on her violets.  The day of the embassy ball arrived. Nobody suspected Eliza in ignoble origins. The surrounding ones were delighted with the manners of a girl and only a professor continued to treat her as an experiment. After the ball, upset Eliza told to a man all she thought about him. After leaving his house, she faced with Freddy. Refusing to listen to the boy, the girl went with him to her father and old friends. They did not recognize Eliza in her new gown and with her manners and speech. Father received a bequeathing from an American millionaire of 4000 pounds and now was going to marry his female partner. Realizing that she no longer belongs to this circle, she left them.  The professor was angry about the behavior of a girl. Higgins said that he was glad Eliza walked away, but he has already started to miss the florist. The man put in a phonograph the record made during his first lesson with a girl. He heard own harsh words towards Eliza. Realizing the truth of florist, the man was sure that she would never return to him. Suddenly in the house of Higgins, slang speech sounded again. Eliza stood in the doorway and saw the professor's reaction to the record. She decided to return to Higgins, of which he was very happy."
Evita," Act IOn 26 July 1952, a crowd in Buenos Aires, Argentina is watching a film (""A Cinema in Buenos Aires, 26 July 1952"") that is interrupted when news breaks of the death of First Lady Eva Perón. Both the crowd and the nation go into public mourning (""Requiem for Evita"") as Ché, a member of the public, marvels at the spectacle and promises to show how Eva did ""nothing, for years"" (""Oh What a Circus"").In 1934, 15-year-old Eva Duarte lives in the provincial town of Junín, and longs to seek a better life in Buenos Aires. Eva falls in love with a tango singer, Agustín Magaldi, after she meets him at one of his shows (""On This Night of a Thousand Stars""). Eva persuades Magaldi to take her with him to Buenos Aires and though he is initially resistant, he eventually accepts (""Eva, Beware of the City""). Upon her arrival at the city, Eva sings about her hopes and ambitions of glory as an actress (""Buenos Aires""). After her arrival, Eva is quick to leave Magaldi, and Che relates the story of how Eva sleeps her way up the social ladder, becoming a model, radio star, and actress (""Goodnight and Thank You""). He then tells of both a right-wing coup in 1943 and Eva's success, implying that Argentine politics and Eva's career may soon coincide. Che also makes a point to introduce the figure of Colonel Juan Domingo Perón, an ambitious military colonel who was making his way up the Argentine political ladder (""The Lady's Got Potential""). In a game of musical chairs that represents the rise of political figures, Perón and other military figures compete for power and exhibit their political strategy (""The Art of the Possible"").After a devastating earthquake hits the town of San Juan, Perón organizes a charity concert at Luna Park to provide aid to the victims. Eva attends and briefly reunites with Agustín Magaldi, who coldly shuns her for her past actions. Perón addresses the crowd with words of encouragement and leaps off the stage, meeting Eva as soon as he exits (""Charity Concert""). Eva and Perón share a secret rendezvous following the charity concert, where Eva hints that she could help Perón rise to power (""I'd Be Surprisingly Good For You""). Eva dismisses Perón's Mistress (the character is known only by that title), who ponders the rejection (""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"").Upon moving in with Perón, Eva is introduced to high society only to be met with disdain from the upper classes and the Argentine Army (""Perón's Latest Flame""). In 1946, after launching his presidential bid, Perón discusses his chances of winning the election with Eva. After reassuring him of their chances of winning, Eva organizes rallies for the descamisados and gives them hope for a better future while Perón and his allies plot to dispose of anyone who stands in their way (""A New Argentina"").During the period between Act I and Act II, Eva and Perón are married – a fact merely alluded to, in the ""Casa Rosada balcony"" scene, at the start of Act II.Act IIPerón is elected President in a sweeping victory in 1946. He stands ""On The Balcony of the Casa Rosada"" addressing his descamisados (shirtless ones). Eva speaks from the balcony of the Presidential Palace to her adoring supporters, where she reveals that despite her initial goal of achieving fame and glory, she has found her true calling to be the people of her country (""Don't Cry for Me, Argentina""). Che analyses the price of fame as Eva dances at the Inaugural Ball with Perón, now the president-elect (""High Flying, Adored"").Eva insists on a glamorous image to impress the people of Argentina and promote Perónism. She prepares to tour in Europe as she is dressed for success by her fashion consultants (""Rainbow High""). Her famous 1946 tour meets with mixed results (""Rainbow Tour""); Spaniards adore her, but the Italians liken her husband to Benito Mussolini. France is impressed, and the English snub her by inviting her to a country estate, rather than Buckingham Palace. Eva affirms her disdain for the upper class, while Che asks her to start helping those in need as she promised (""The Actress Hasn't Learned the Lines (You'd Like to Hear)""). Eva begins the Eva Perón Foundation to direct her charity work. Che describes Eva's controversial charitable work, and possible money laundering (""And the Money Kept Rolling In (And Out)"").Eva appears at a church to take the sacrament in front of her adoring supporters (""Santa Evita""), but passes out suddenly, and while unconscious, appears to have a dream that reflects upon the conflicting views of her life. In her dream, she and Che heatedly debate her actions; Che accuses Eva of using the Argentine people for her own ends, while Eva cynically replies that there is no glory in trying to solve the world's problems from the sidelines (""A Waltz for Eva and Che""). At the end of the argument, Eva finally admits to herself and Che that she is dying and can't go on for much longer. Che points out the disastrous results of Perón's policies on Argentina: its treasury is bankrupt, its once-thriving beef industry under rationing, and the press and other critics of the regime muzzled.Perón's generals finally get sick of Eva's meddling and demand that Perón force her to leave politics. However, Perón objects and claims that if it wasn't for her, they would never have achieved as much as they have (""She Is a Diamond""). But he also concedes that she won't be able to keep working for long as she will soon succumb to her cancer. Even so, Eva is determined to run for Vice President, and Perón fears that the military will stage a coup if she runs and that Eva's health is too delicate for any stressful work, but Eva insists that she can continue, despite her failing health (""Dice Are Rolling/Eva's Sonnet"").Realizing that she is close to death, Eva renounces her pursuit of the vice presidency and swears her eternal love to the people of Argentina (""Eva's Final Broadcast""). Eva's achievements flash before her eyes before she dies (""Montage""), and she asks for forgiveness, contemplating her choice of fame instead of long life (""Lament""). Eva dies, and embalmers preserve her body forever. Che notes that a monument was set to be built for Evita but ""only the pedestal was completed when Evita's body disappeared for 17 years...""","The beginning of the musical takes place in the auditorium, where people watching a movie and it is interrupted by a message in Spanish that Evita has died. The whole country is in a big grieve and the audience of the musical was moved to the meeting scene with her. Evita, formerly called Eve, begins her journey in this show as a 15-year-old girl that falls in love with one of the organizers of the dance show. She flirts with him and sleeps, and then begins to blackmail, so he took her to the capital, Buenos Aires, where she abandons him just in a few days, admiring this city and want to live here. The ex-lover watches her from the sidelines as she makes her way to the top, jumping from bed to bed, starting from the model, then becoming a popular radio host, and then – an actress, star of the screen.  Then the viewer sees a figure of one of the military generals who gains power and builds his political career so that eventually to become a president. His name is Perón and Evita (already matured for 10 years) gets acquainted with him and stays with him and once saying that she can be very useful for the realization of his ambitious plans. Through the influence of the general, Evita becomes a part of the secular society, but she was rejected there and mocked, obviously, because of her low birth social status.  General enters the presidential race and Evita once, lying in bed with him, develop a plan by which all other candidates for the presidency must be eliminated one way or another.  After her husband's brilliant election on presidency, Eva begins to realize that her true calling – is to help the people of the country, not just to succeed, for what she has starved. Now as she's at the top, she starts to promote her husband among neighboring countries. Hiring image consultants, they made her look appropriate in clothing and appearance. She departs for a tour in other countries. It goes mostly with negative success, because in one country her husband was compared with Benito Mussolini, and in another, instead of the royals, she was directed to a certain country cottage, thereby causing a contemptuous insult for her. She is more and more disillusioned with the secular society.  Then she remembers her promise to help people and she establishes a charitable foundation, the activities of which cause some people to have questions because there it goes laundering of her husband’s money through this fund. Many years later, she begins to feel ill, knowing that her death comes soon enough. She also realizes that her husband loves her not because of what she did for the country or for him personally, but for what she is.  Years later, generals of Perón tired of the constant attempts of his wife to manage the politics, and want that he suspended her activities, but he reminds them that if not for her help, they now wouldn’t occupy such high positions in society. Although ill with cancer disease, Evita wants to run for vice presidency, contrary to her husband and others saying she shouldn’t do it. After a while, she leaves the undertaking, as she was overcame by cancer & now she is on her deathbed. Her achievements are flashily shown before the eyes of viewers before she dies. Specialists of embalming keep her body and her tomb has begun to be build, but not ended, because someone stole her corpse."
Jesus Christ Superstar,"  Act I Judas Iscariot, one of the Twelve Apostles, worries that the followers of Jesus are getting out of control and may be seen as a threat by the Roman Empire, who might harshly suppress them (""Heaven on Their Minds""). The other apostles anticipate going to Jerusalem with Jesus and ask him about his plans, but Jesus tells them not to worry about the future (""What's the Buzz""). Mary Magdalene tries to help Jesus relax. Judas tells Jesus that he should not associate with Mary, because a relationship with a prostitute could be seen as inconsistent with his own teachings and be used against him (""Strange Thing Mystifying""). Jesus tells Judas that he should not judge others unless he is without sin. Jesus then reproaches the apostles and complains that none of them truly cares about him. Mary Magdalene tries to reassure Jesus while anointing him with oil (""Everything's Alright""). Judas angrily says that the money spent on oil should have been used to help the poor. Jesus answers that they do not have the resources to end poverty, and that they should be glad for what comforts they have.Meanwhile, Caiaphas, the High Priest of Israel, assembles the Pharisees and priests. Like Judas they fear that Jesus's followers will be seen as a threat by the Romans, and that many Jews might suffer the consequences. Caiaphas concludes that for the greater good, Jesus must be killed (""This Jesus Must Die""). As Jesus and his followers arrive exultantly in Jerusalem, they are confronted by Caiaphas, who demands that Jesus disperse the crowd. Jesus instead greets the happy crowd (""Hosanna""). Then Simon the Zealot suggests that Jesus lead his mob in a war against Rome and gain absolute power. Jesus rejects this, stating that none of his followers understand what true power is (""Simon Zealotes/Poor Jerusalem"").Pontius Pilate, the governor of Judea, has a dream in which he meets a Galilean and then receives the blame for the man's violent death at the hands of a mob (""Pilate's Dream""). Jesus arrives at the Temple and finds that it is being used as a marketplace; angered by this, he drives everyone out (""The Temple""). A group of lepers ask Jesus to heal them. Their number increases, and overwhelmed, Jesus rejects them. Mary Magdalene sings him to sleep. While he sleeps, Mary acknowledges that she is in love with him, and it frightens her (""I Don't Know How to Love Him"").Conflicted, Judas seeks out the Pharisees and proposes helping them arrest Jesus, believing that Jesus is out of control and that Jesus himself would approve of his action. In exchange for his help, Judas is offered thirty pieces of silver. Judas initially refuses, then accepts when Caiaphas suggests that he can use the money to help the poor (""Damned for All Time/Blood Money""). Act II At the Last Supper, Jesus is stung when the others get drunk and pay little attention to him. He remarks that ""for all you care"" the wine they are drinking could be his blood and the bread his body. He asks them to remember him, then frustrated by their lack of understanding, he predicts that Peter will deny him three times that night, and that another one of them will betray him. Judas admits that he is the one who will betray Jesus and, saying that he does not understand why Jesus did not plan things better, he leaves.The remaining apostles fall asleep, and Jesus retreats to the Garden of Gethsemane to pray (""Gethsemane (I Only Want to Say)""). He tells God his doubts about whether his mission has had any success, and angrily demands to know why he should continue and suffer the horrible death that awaits him. Receiving no answer, he realises that he cannot defy God's will, and surrenders to God.Judas arrives with Roman soldiers and identifies Jesus by kissing him on the cheek (""The Arrest""). When Jesus is brought to trial before the Sanhedrin, Caiaphas demands to know if he calls himself the Son of God, and Jesus responds merely ""That's what you say"". Caiaphas says that this is sufficient evidence and sends him to Pilate. Meanwhile, Peter is confronted by three people, to whom he denies that he knows Jesus (""Peter's Denial""). Mary observes that Jesus had predicted this.Pilate asks Jesus if he is the King of the Jews. Jesus again answers ""That's what you say"". Since Jesus is from Galilee, Pilate says that he is not under his jurisdiction and sends him to King Herod (""Pilate and Christ""). The flamboyant King Herod asks Jesus to prove his divinity by performing miracles (""King Herod's Song""), but Jesus ignores him. Herod angrily sends him back to Pilate. Mary Magdalene, Peter, and the apostles remember when they first began following Jesus, and wish that they could return to a time of peace (""Could We Start Again, Please?"").Judas is horrified at Jesus's harsh treatment. He expresses regret to the Pharisees, fearing that he will forever be remembered as a traitor. Caiaphas and Annas assure him that he has done the right thing. Judas throws down the money he was given and storms out. He curses God for manipulating him, and commits suicide (""Judas's Death"").At Jesus's trial, Pilate attempts to interrogate Jesus, but is cut off by a bloodthirsty mob which demands that Jesus be crucified. He tells the mob that Jesus has committed no crime and does not deserve to die, but to satisfy the mob he will have Jesus flogged (""Trial Before Pilate""). Pilate pleads with Jesus to defend himself, but Jesus says weakly that everything has been determined by God. The crowd still calls for Jesus's death and finally Pilate reluctantly agrees to crucify Jesus.As Jesus awaits crucifixion, he is haunted by the ghost of Judas, who asks why Jesus chose to arrive in the manner and time that he did, and if it was all part of a divine plan (""Superstar""). Jesus is crucified, recites his final words and dies (""The Crucifixion""). ","The musical begins with a display of the presence of the confrontation between Judas Iscariot and his teacher, Jesus, whom first considers only a man, not a God or His messenger, and criticizes him that Jesus too uncritically accepts all new followers, fearing of gaining popularity among the people by Him. Jesus and his disciples want to go to Jerusalem, planning days, he calls them not worry too much about the future – there will be what will be. Judas reveals his true commitment to Christ, because he worries about his name, and the consistency of the teaching, as Issa has tied himself with a prostitute Mary Magdalene, whom Judas condemns. But Issa tells him that ""don’t judge and will not be judged"", and we all are not sinless, by means of that originating in his follower confusion and anger. When Mary is trying to oil his body with olive oil, Issa is angry that the money could be given to the poor, that is, their current use is irrational. Jesus at this stage shows all the features of the ordinary, though very sensible, person, because there are anger, blame and carelessness about the future present in him.  Several high priests of Rome, watching what is going on with Jesus and his teachings, come to the conclusion that the spread of his doctrine should be stopped, and he himself – destroyed, as an element that threatens to the existence of socio-political system of Rome. All his followers and even those who do not share the teachings are under attack. Because with the fall of the power of the Roman Empire, statehood and civilization will cease too, causing irreparable harm to the public. High priests want to avoid this in the first place. After the entry of Jesus and his followers in Jerusalem, he becomes an aim of attacks, even up to the point that he wanted to make a coup d’état, which he, of course, denies in those words, that in this city no one knows his real intentions. Issa sees that the city, in which he has entered, has become the center of debauchery, lust and arms trafficking, and is horrified by this state of affairs. In one of his most famous scenes of rage, he chases the merchants and moneychangers out of the temple, which is a sacred place.  After that, people starting to arrive to him, unhealthy physically and mentally, he begins to treat them, but their flow is so great that he abandons this idea, proclaiming all they should treat themselves. He does not have enough time to rest. Maria discovers that she is in love with her mentor. Judah does not like this situation, he expressed jealousy towards woman, as he wants that the teacher was close only to him, not knowing that the gift and philosophy of Issa is the property of the whole world. He conspires with the high priests of Rome and sells them Christ for 30 pieces of silver, because he did not want His popularity has increased very high.  At the Last Supper, Judas says bad words to Jesus and come after custody, so they grabbed Him, while the rest of the followers did not do anything to save Him, falling asleep. Issa goes to pray to God so he gave him strengths, coming into the place where the soldiers are ready to capture Issa. He already wants to go back to God, so that he took him, because He feels that he cannot be the salvation for people anymore.  After his arrest, which the apostles could not resist (and Issa told them not to do so), he refused to comment on its further action, is judged first by a court of faith, where preside the priests, and then he was sent to the law court to Pilate. Meanwhile his chief disciple Peter renounces his mentor, fearing for own life, and then leaves in pilgrimage, carrying word of his faith to other people. Issa is transmitted to the king of those lands, so the latter said his final accusation word, and the king even says that will free him if Issa will show his ""tricks"" with healing, but because Christ ignores it, the king is beginning to enrage and assigns the court over him to Pontius.  Judas feels bad, understanding that betrayed his mentor and best friend, wants to repent before the high priests, but chosen own audience very badly and they did not really listen to him and then pushing him out of the temple, dooming him to the terrible pangs of conscience. He interrupts his despair in suicide.  On execution, the crowd calls him to be crucified, and the judges decide that He is no more than an ordinary human being, not a prophet, not a son of God. Pilate appoint Issa different penalty, trying to satisfy the bloodthirsty mob, although previously he wanted to confine a milder punishment, perhaps even his imprisonment, but keeping him alive. But the raging crowd did not allow him to do only some moderate punishment, so he was crucified. All, except of the spirit of Judas, were sad about this event, recalling the changes that Issa has brought in their lives."
Annie,"  Act 1 In 1933, eleven-year-old Annie is in the Municipal Girls Orphanage, along with Molly (age 6), Kate (age 7), Tessie (age 10), Pepper (age 12), July and Duffy (both 13). When Molly awakes from a bad dream, angering Pepper and Duffy, July tells them to hush up and eventually gets into a fight with Pepper. Annie gets up and tells everyone to go back to sleep. Molly then asks if Annie could read her note from when her parents left her at the orphanage. Duffy and Pepper are yet again annoyed. Along with Kate, Pepper and Duffy imitate Annie's acting as if they were her parents (""Maybe"").Annie decides to escape to find her parents, but is caught by Miss Hannigan, manager of the orphanage, who is suffering the effects of a hangover. Short-tempered as a result, she forces all the girls vigorously to clean the orphanage (""Hard Knock Life"") before commencing their day of sweatshop labour, sewing for a dress-manufacturing company (from which Miss Hannigan pockets the proceeds). Shortly afterwards, Mr. Bundles, the laundryman, comes in to pick up the blankets. While Miss Hannigan is flirting with him, Annie climbs into the laundry-basket and the orphans cover her up with the blankets. Once Miss Hannigan realizes she is gone, the other orphans express their frustration (""Hard Knock Life (Reprise)"").Annie successfully escapes, running into a friendly stray dog. As she comforts him, she tells him of better days yet to come (""Tomorrow""). The dog catcher is after him, so she pretends the dog is hers by calling him Sandy. Though at first unpersuasive, she convinces the dog catcher, and continues on. She later finds a Hooverville, where people made homeless by the Great Depression have come together as a community (""We'd Like to Thank You""). However, a policeman named Lt. Ward, who had been sent by Miss Hannigan, catches Annie and brings her back.Grace Farrell, assistant to the billionaire Oliver Warbucks, comes to the orphanage asking for an orphan to come to his mansion for the Christmas holiday. Because Annie was in Miss Hannigan's office, Grace asks to take her, and Miss Hannigan reluctantly agrees. Once she has left, Miss Hannigan explodes with her hatred for all the girls in the orphanage (""Little Girls"").Meanwhile, at the Warbucks Mansion, the staff welcomes Annie with open arms (""I Think I'm Gonna Like It Here""). When Oliver Warbucks comes back, though, he is not happy to have an orphan in his mansion. He asks Grace to take Annie to a movie, but  she persuades him to come too. As he and Annie begin to like each other, they enjoy a fabulous night in New York City (""N.Y.C."").Back at the orphanage, Miss Hannigan's ne'er-do-well brother, Rooster, and his unscrupulous girlfriend, Lily, pay a visit. Miss Hannigan mentions that Annie is staying at a billionaire's house, and they decide they can use this situation to their advantage, though they do not yet know how (""Easy Street"").Warbucks sees a modestly priced locket around Annie's neck, and buys her a new one from Tiffany & Co. He debates taking her ""under his wing"", concerned that he doesn't know much about children, but he realizes that he loves her and gives her the locket (""Why Should I Change A Thing?""). However, she bursts into tears, saying it was the only thing left by her parents, and refuses to accept a new one. Grace and the staff then pledge to find her parents no matter what it takes (""You Won't Be An Orphan For Long""). Act 2 Annie appears on the radio on a show by Bert Healy (""Maybe"" reprise) where Warbucks announces that he is offering $50,000 to the couple who can prove they are her parents. Healy then sings a song with the Boylan Sisters (""You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile""). Back at the orphanage the girls are listening to the song. Everyone is fascinated that their friend is on the radio, except Pepper; who couldn't care less. (""You're Never Fully Dressed Without a Smile"" reprise). When Miss Hannigan hears, she barges in and demands to know what was happening. Molly announces that Annie was on the radio, and that there is a $50,000 reward for her parents. Miss Hannigan is anything but pleased. Shortly after, a couple named Ralph and Shirley Mudge arrive, saying they left a little girl here eleven years ago and have come back for her. Miss Hannigan is shocked. They soon reveal themselves to be Rooster and Lily; they explain their plan to get the reward. They request information about Annie from Miss Hannigan for one third of the money, though she demands one half for this service, and she tells them about the note and the locket (""Easy Street"" reprise).Warbucks brings Annie to Washington, D.C., where she requests to meet the president. Warbucks thinks that it would be better if Annie waited outside, but Franklin D. Roosevelt asks her to stay. She begins to sing ""Tomorrow"", though shushed by the cabinet. Roosevelt, however, believes that people must be optimistic during tough times, and commands them to sing (""Tomorrow"" Cabinet reprise). Once back home, Warbucks tells Annie how much he loves her (""Something Was Missing""). Because her parents have not shown up, he announces he would like to adopt her (""I Don't Need Anything But You""). They decide to throw a Christmas party, and Annie wants to invite Miss Hannigan and the orphans. While preparing, the delighted staff tell of how her arrival has changed their lives (""Annie"").Judge Louis Brandeis shows up to begin the adoption proceedings, but is interrupted by Mr. and Mrs. Mudge (Rooster and Lily in disguise) who come to pick up Annie. Grace and Warbucks are shocked, because they know about the note and the locket. Still, Warbucks does not think they are her real parents. He requests that she will be allowed to stay one more night for the Christmas party, and then they can take her away to their supposed pig farm in New Jersey. Early that morning, she wishes she could have been adopted, not sent off with her ""parents"" (""Maybe"" reprise). Warbucks then receives a surprise visit from Roosevelt and his Secret Service. It is revealed by him that Annie's parents are actually David and Margaret Bennett, who died when she was a baby. They then realize that Mr. and Mrs. Mudge are really Rooster and Lily, just as they show up to claim her and the money. They are arrested for their crimes by the Secret Service, along with Miss Hannigan for being their accomplice, Annie is adopted by Warbucks, and everyone is delighted by Roosevelt's new deal for the economy (""A New Deal for Christmas""/""Tomorrow"").","Act One  Events take place during the Great Depression in 1933, in the municipal shelter for orphans, in a wing for girls of all ages, with its hierarchy. Where older look after younger, and those – for the smallest ones. Where poverty, denunciations and mutual responsibility prevail.

The action revolves around one orphan named Annie, who left at the entrance to the shelter, with silver pendant’s half and the second half parents had left to themselves to be identified, if they come to take her out of the shelter someday. She was picked up by the owner of the orphanage – angry spinster lady who is very tough to everyone.  Annie really wants to find her parents and she always brings confusion into the ranks of the children from the orphanage, so she is always on the pencil from Miss Hannigan, the owner.  Annie escapes from the orphanage, picks yard dog, then she is arrested by the police, the dog runs away, then Annie comes back in handcuffs to the shelter, and then by a happy coincidence, were chosen by secretary of billionaire Mr. Warbucks, who wants to do a good deed and to take the orphan from the shelter for 2 weeks.

Fake father and mother claimed Annie and money in the mansion of Mr. Warbucks, demanding a check, but he began to suspect, and with the help of FBI found out that the real parents of Annie died many years ago, and the false fakers are exposed to arrest, together with the owner of the shelter.

Mr. Warbucks signs papers for adoption of Annie, and they're both immensely pleased with this event, as they found kindred spirits in each other."
Singin' in the Rain," Don Lockwood is a silent film star with humble roots as a musician, dancer and stunt man.  Don barely tolerates his vapid leading lady, Lina Lamont, who is convinced that their screen romance is real, although Don tries to tell her otherwise. After the first talking picture, The Jazz Singer, proves to be a smash hit, the head of the studio, R. F. Simpson, decides he has no choice but to convert the new Lockwood and Lamont film, The Dueling Cavalier, into a talkie. The production is beset with difficulties, by far the worst being Lina's comically grating voice.After a disastrous test screening, Don's best friend, Cosmo Brown, comes up with the idea to overdub Lina's voice and they convince Simpson to turn The Dueling Cavalier into The Dancing Cavalier, a musical comedy film. Meanwhile, Don falls in love with an aspiring actress, Kathy Selden, who is providing the voice for Lina. When Lina finds out, she is furious and does everything possible to sabotage the romance. She maliciously demands that Kathy continue to provide her voice in all future films, but remain uncredited. An irate, but desperate Simpson is forced to agree; Kathy has no choice because she is under contract.The premiere is a tremendous success. When the audience clamors for Lina to sing live, Don and Cosmo improvise and get Lina to lip-synch while Kathy sings into a second microphone while hidden behind the curtain. Unbeknownst to Lina, as she starts ""singing"", Don, Cosmo and Simpson gleefully raise the curtain behind her, revealing the deception. Kathy becomes a star, and Lina is finished.","This is the story about Don Lockwood – star of silent films, who began his career as a musician, a dancer and even a stuntman. The protagonist barely tolerates the antics of selfish and superficial Lina Lamont, that is his on-screen partner. Despite this, the studio Monumental Pictures at every opportunity connects artists with romantic relationship. This is done exclusively in order to increase their popularity and one of movies with their participation. Interestingly, Lina herself began to believe that between her and Don there is some connection. But in fact, it is a complete lies. At the premiere of a new movie called ‘The Royal Rascal’, actor tells to the assembled audience slightly embellished version of his personal life. Lockwood also voiced his motto, which is as follows: dignity is always worthy.  In order to get away from his fans quickly after the premiere, Don jumps into the first passing-by car, driven by a dancer Kathy Selden. She responds with a sneer on his works and says that the silent antics unworthy of such attention of the public. Later, at some studio party, its head R. F. Simpson demonstrates the guests of the event the filming picture, but they find it almost unimpressive. They estimated it as something vulgar and frivolous. At the same time, Don meets Kathy for the second time. Now he does a mild mocking on her, but receives a response in a couple of minutes in the form of a cake throw. The actor manages to dodge, and the cake flies directly to Lina's face. Obstinate dancer leaves the party as if nothing had happened. The protagonist is shocked by this act, and he really gets interested in person of his new acquaintance. After several weeks of searching, he finds Kathy working in other studio. She confesses that she has always been a big fan of Don’s work.  After the incredible success of film ‘The Jazz Singer’, released by the studio-rival, R. F. Simpson decides to take the next sound joint project of Lockwood and Lamont. He even has a name of the future brainchild – ‘The Duelling Cavalier’. But on the first day of filming team faces many challenges. The most important of these is certainly a raspy voice of Lina and her strong New York’s accent. Disgruntled diction coach tries to teach the actress to pronounce the replica correctly, but to no avail. Screening results also fail: due to improper placement of microphones, sound turned barely audible. In the middle of the scene, it goes out of sync at all, which adds slightly amusing result.  Don, Kathy and Cosmo enter the studio with the idea to turn ‘The Duelling Cavalier’ into a musical called ‘The Dancing Cavalier’, the basis of which should be a number ‘Broadway Melody’. But the question of what to do with Lina’s voice, remains open. Cosmo offers to sound character of Lina with voice of Kathy. R. F. approves the idea, and the result completely justifies itself. However, this fact expectedly frustrates Lina. She arranges hysterics, threatening to sue the studio, but in the end, continues to work.  ‘The Dancing Cavalier’ experiences a huge success at the box office. When the audience asks the actors to sing live, Lina just opens own mouth at synchronized sound. At this point, Don, Cosmo and R. F. raise the curtain and announce the real star – Kathy. Lina leaves the scene in tears, and Don and Kathy continue to bathe in the glory. Passionate kiss of the main characters is a perfect ending of this action."
The Music Man,"  Act I In the early summer of 1912, aboard a train leaving Rock Island, Illinois, Charlie Cowell and other traveling salesmen debate whether innovations are making their profession more difficult. ""Professor"" Harold Hill is raised as one whose sales skills make him immune from such changes (""Rock Island""). Charlie says that Hill is a con man who promises to form boys marching bands then skips town after taking payments for instruments and uniforms. Upon the train's arrival in River City, Iowa, a passenger leaves the train with a suitcase labeled ""Professor Harold Hill"".After townspeople of River City describe their reserved, ""chip-on-the-shoulder attitude"" (""Iowa Stubborn""), Harold sees his old friend and shill, Marcellus Washburn, who has ""gone legit"" and now lives in the town. Marcellus tells Harold that Marian Paroo, the librarian who gives piano lessons, is the only trained musician in town. He also informs Hill that a new pool table was just delivered to the town's local billiard parlor, so to launch his scheme, Harold convinces River City parents of the ""trouble"" that can come from a pool table (""Ya Got Trouble""). Harold follows Marian home, attempting to flirt with her, but she ignores him. Marian gives a piano lesson to a little girl named Amaryllis while arguing with her widowed mother about her high ""standards where men are concerned""; she mentions the man who followed her home (""Piano Lesson/If You Don't Mind My Saying So""). Marian's self-conscious 10-year-old brother Winthrop arrives home. Amaryllis, who secretly likes Winthrop but teases him about his lisp, asks Marian to whom she should say goodnight on the evening star, since she doesn't have a sweetheart. Marian tells her to just say goodnight to her ""someone"" (""Goodnight, My Someone"").The next day, Mayor Shinn and his overbearing wife Eulalie MacKecknie Shinn lead the festivities for Independence Day at the high school gym (""Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean"") but are interrupted by a firecracker set off by troublemaker Tommy Djilas. Harold takes the stage and announces to the townspeople that he will prevent ""sin and corruption"" from the pool table by forming a boys' band (""Ya Got Trouble [reprise]/Seventy-Six Trombones""). Mayor Shinn, who owns the billiard parlor, tells the bickering school board to get Harold's credentials, but Harold gets them to sing as a Barbershop Quartet to distract them (""Ice Cream/Sincere""). Harold also sets up Zaneeta, the mayor's eldest daughter, with Tommy, and persuades Tommy to work as his assistant. After another rejection by Marian, Harold is determined to win her (""The Sadder But Wiser Girl""). The town ladies are very excited about the band and the ladies' dance committee that Harold plans to form. He mentions Marian, and they imply (falsely, it turns out) that she had an affair with a now-deceased miser, who willed the library building to the town but left all the books to Marian. They warn Harold that she advocates ""dirty books"" by ""Chaucer, Rabelais and Balzac"" (""Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little""). The school board arrives to review Harold's credentials, but he leads them in song and slips away (""Goodnight, Ladies"").The next day, Harold walks into the library to woo Marian in earnest (""Marian the Librarian""). For a moment, she forgets her decorum and dances with Harold and the teenagers. Harold kisses her; when she tries to slap him, she accidentally hits Tommy instead. With Tommy's help, Harold signs up all the boys in town to be in his band, including Winthrop. Mrs. Paroo likes Harold and tries to find out why Marian is not interested. Marian describes her ideal man (""My White Knight""). She sets out to give Mayor Shinn evidence against Harold that she found in the Indiana State Educational Journal, but they are interrupted by the arrival of the Wells Fargo wagon, which delivers the band instruments (""The Wells Fargo Wagon""). When Winthrop forgets to be shy and self-conscious because he is so happy about his new cornet, Marian begins to see Harold in a new light. She tears the incriminating page out of the Journal before giving the book to Mayor Shinn. Act II The ladies rehearse their classical dance in the school gym while the school board practices their quartet (""It's You"") for the ice cream social. Marcellus and the town's teenagers interrupt the ladies' practice, taking over the gym as they dance (""Shipoopi""). Harold grabs Marian to dance with her, and all the teenagers join in. Regarding Winthrop's cornet, Marian later questions Harold about his claim that ""you don't have to bother with the notes"". He explains that this is what he calls ""The Think System"", and he arranges to call on Marian to discuss it. The town ladies ask Marian to join their dance committee, since she was ""so dear dancing the Shipoopi"" with Professor Hill (""Pick-a-Little, Talk-a-Little"" [Reprise]). They have reversed their opinions about her books, and they eagerly tell her that ""the Professor told us to read those books, and we simply adored them all!""That night, the school board tries to collect Harold's credentials again, but he gets them to sing again and slips away (""Lida Rose""). Marian, meanwhile, is sitting on her front porch thinking of Harold (""Will I Ever Tell You?""). Winthrop returns home after spending time with Harold and tells Marian and Mrs. Paroo about Harold's hometown (""Gary, Indiana""). As Marian waits alone for Harold, traveling salesman Charlie Cowell enters with evidence against Harold, hoping to tell Mayor Shinn. He only has a few minutes before his train leaves, but stops to flirt with Marian. She delays him so he won't have time to deliver the evidence, eventually kissing him. As the train whistle blows, she pushes him away. Charlie angrily tells Marian that Harold has a girl in ""every county in Illinois, and he's taken it from every one of them – and that's 102 counties!""Harold arrives, and after he reminds her of the untrue rumors he's heard about her, she convinces herself that Charlie invented everything he told her. They agree to meet at the footbridge, where Marian tells him the difference he's made in her life (""Till There Was You""). Marcellus interrupts and tells Harold that the uniforms have arrived. He urges Harold to take the money and run, but Harold refuses to leave, insisting, ""I've come up through the ranks... and I'm not resigning without my commission"". He returns to Marian, who tells him that she's known since three days after he arrived that he is a fraud. (Harold earlier claimed to have graduated from the Gary Conservatory in 1905, but Gary, Indiana, was not founded until 1906.) Because she loves him, she gives him the incriminating page out of the Indiana State Educational Journal. She leaves, promising to see him later at the Sociable. With his schemes for the boys' band and Marian proceeding even better than planned, Harold confidently sings ""Seventy-Six Trombones"". As he overhears Marian singing ""Goodnight My Someone"", Harold suddenly realizes that he is in love with Marian; he and Marian sing a snatch of each other's songs.Meanwhile, Charlie Cowell, who has missed his train, arrives at the ice cream social and denounces Harold Hill as a fraud. The townspeople begin an agitated search for Harold. Winthrop is heartbroken and tells Harold that he wishes Harold never came to River City. But Marian tells Winthrop that she believes everything Harold ever said, for it did come true in the way every kid in town talked and acted that summer. She and Winthrop urge Harold to get away. He chooses to stay and tells Marian that he never really fell in love until he met her (""Till There Was You"" [Reprise]). The constable then handcuffs Harold and leads him away.Mayor Shinn leads a meeting in the high school gym to decide what to do with Harold, asking, ""Where's the band? Where's the band?""  Marian defends Harold. Tommy enters as a drum major, followed by the kids in uniform with their instruments. Marian urges Harold to lead the River City Boys' Band in Beethoven's Minuet in G. Despite the boys' limited musical ability, the parents in the audience are nonetheless enraptured by the sight of their children playing music. Even Mayor Shinn is won over, and, as the townspeople cheer, Harold is released into Marian's arms (""Finale"").","The action of the musical takes place in 1912. Several salesmen, including the main character, are travelling by train. They are arguing about credits. But their conversation soon moves to a one of well-known scammers. He is famous for deceiving parents, offering to teach their kids playing musical instruments. When he gets money, he disappears. One of the sales representatives stands up and leaves the train. He appears to be that scammer, as his name is written on his suitcase.  We see this cheater in Iowa (River City), where he visits his old friend. There he also becomes acquainted with the only musician in the town – a librarian. The man follows her trying to flirt, but she does not pay attention to him. At home, she is reaching a little girl playing the piano. After this, she argues with her mother about men and high standards of the girl. The student is in love with the little brother of her teacher.  The following day is the fourth of July. The festival is prepared in the school gym. But it is disturbed by a firecracker made by a boy from the bad part of the city. The scammer announces that he is going to prevent sins in the town and will form a band. He still tries to win the librarian’s heart. He is sure she is a right woman for him. He creates a band and many people like it. The ladies of the town find out about his affection and say false things about her inappropriate relations with an old man. The school board tries to get the scammers’ credentials. He comes to the library to win the woman’s attention again. Everyone, including them, starts dancing. They kiss. But the woman still doesn’t like him. But her mother does. She is trying to understand, why her daughter ignores the man. The librarian describes her ideal partner. She finds some evidence about the fraud of the scammer and decides to uncover them to the mayor. But the wagon with instruments arrives, and they have to stop the conversation.

Matilda,"  Act I As a chorus of children boast about being their parents' miracles, the ballroom dancing-obsessed Mrs. Wormwood gives birth to a baby girl called Matilda. The doctor thinks Matilda is the most beautiful child he has ever seen, but Mrs. Wormwood is only worried about a dancing contest she has missed. Similarly shallow, Mr. Wormwood—a used-car salesman and television addict—dismisses the child when he realizes she is a girl ('Miracle'). Five years later, Matilda is an avid reader and lives unhappily with her parents and her older, gormless brother Michael. The Wormwoods are oblivious to her genius and frequently mock and verbally abuse her. Matilda adds some of her mother's hydrogen peroxide to her father's hair oil, leaving Mr. Wormwood with bright green hair ('Naughty').At the local library Matilda tells Mrs. Phelps a story about a world-famous acrobat and escapologist couple who long to have a child but they can't. To distract themselves from their sadness they announce to the world's press that they will perform an exciting and dangerous new act. The next day is Matilda's first day at school ('School Song'). Her teacher Miss Honey is impressed by Matilda's precociousness and ability, so she recommends that Matilda be moved to the top class with the older children ('Pathetic'). However, the child-hating, disciplinarian headmistress Miss Trunchbull, a former world champion hammer thrower, dismisses Miss Honey's suggestion and lectures her on the importance of following rules ('The Hammer').At the Wormwoods' house, Mr. Wormwood is frustrated about losing a sale of worn-out cars to a group of rich Russians. He takes his frustration out on Matilda and destroys one of her library books, prompting her to put superglue around the rim of his hat and fix it to his head. At school, Matilda is told of Miss Trunchbull's cruel punishments, including Chokey: a tiny cupboard lined with sharp objects in which she locks disobedient children for hours ('Chokey Chant'). Matilda sees Miss Trunchbull spin a small girl, Amanda Thripp around by her pigtails and throw her across the playing field. Meanwhile, Miss Honey decides to visit the Wormwoods to express her recommendation that Matilda be put in an advanced class. She meets Mrs. Wormwood and her dance partner Rudolpho. It soon becomes apparent that Mrs. Wormwood doesn't care about her daughter's intelligence, and she mocks Miss Honey and Matilda's interest in books and intellect ('Loud'). Alone outside the Wormwood's house, Miss Honey is desperate to help Matilda but feels powerless to do so ('This Little Girl').Matilda tells Mrs. Phelps more about the acrobat and the escapologist. The acrobat's sister, a former world champion hammer-thrower who loves to scare small children, has arranged their performance. The escapologist announces that the performance has been cancelled because the acrobat is pregnant. The crowd is thrilled but the acrobat's sister is furious at the prospect of refunding the crowd's money and produces a contract binding them to perform the act or go to jail. At school, Bruce Bogtrotter, a boy in Matilda's class, has stolen a slice of Miss Trunchbull's personal chocolate cake. Miss Trunchbull punishes Bruce by forcing him to eat the entire cake in front of the class, who bravely support him ('Bruce'). After Bruce has finished the cake, the class celebrates his success but Miss Trunchbull drags Bruce away to the Chokey. Act II Mr. Wormwood advises the audience against reading in favour of watching television (“Telly”). Lavender, a girl in Matilda's class, tells the audience that she is going to put a newt in Miss Trunchbull's jug of water later on. The children gather and sing about their hopes for when they grow up ('When I Grow Up'). Matilda resolves to end Miss Trunchbull's cruelty. She tells Mrs. Phelps more of the story of the acrobat and the escapologist. Bound by their contract, they perform their feat, which goes well until the last moment when the acrobat is fatally injured, living just long enough to give birth to a girl. The escapologist invites the acrobat's sister to move in with him to help look after his daughter. Unknown to the escapologist, the girl's aunt is secretly cruel to her, forcing her to perform menial tasks and abusing her verbally and physically.Mr. Wormwood returns home from work pleased because he has sold his worn-out cars to the wealthy Russians, having used an automatic drill to wind back their odometers. Matilda is annoyed at her father's deceit and scolds him, which angers him and he locks her in her bedroom. That night, Matilda continues the story of the acrobat and the escapologist. After years of cruelty, the aunt's rage has grown; one day she beats the child, locks her in the cellar and goes out. That evening, the escapologist returns home early and discovers the extent of the aunt's cruelty. As he comforts his daughter, he promises her he will always be there for her. Filled with rage, he runs out to find the aunt but is never seen again (“I'm Here”).The next day, Miss Trunchbull forces Miss Honey's class to undergo a gruelling physical education lesson (“The Smell of Rebellion”). Miss Trunchbull discovers the newt in her jug; she accuses one of the boys, Eric, who has already riled her during the lesson. She starts to punish him. Matilda scolds Miss Trunchbull for being a bully. Miss Trunchbull verbally abuses Matilda, but Matilda discovers she can move objects with her mind ('Quiet'). She tips over the water jug and the newt lands on Miss Trunchbull, and climbs up her leg. After Miss Trunchbull leaves Matilda demonstrates her powers to Miss Honey, who is surprised and invites Matilda to her house for tea. On the way Matilda admits that her father is not proud of her and calls her names.Miss Honey tells Matilda of her cruel and abusive aunt, who looked after her as a child after her parents died. When Miss Honey first became a teacher, her aunt produced a bill detailing everything Miss Honey consumed as a child, along with other expenses, and forced her to sign a contract binding her to pay it all back. Desperate to escape, Miss Honey found refuge in an old farm shed which she moved into and lives in abject poverty. Despite this, Miss Honey finds beauty in her meagre living conditions ('My House'). As Miss Honey tells her story, she produces a scarf which Matilda recognises from her story of the acrobat and the escapologist—which she realises is the true story of Miss Honey's childhood, and that her wicked aunt is Miss Trunchbull.Back at school, Miss Trunchbull forces the children to take a spelling test; anyone who misspells a word will be sent to Chokey. The children fail to misspell a single word, so Miss Trunchbull invents a word in order to be able to punish Lavender. As Lavender is about to be taken to Chokey, her classmates deliberately misspell simple words, telling her she cannot send them all to Chokey. However, Miss Trunchbull has built many more Chokeys. Matilda uses her powers to write on the blackboard and convinces Miss Trunchbull that it is the ghost of Miss Honey's father, demanding that she give his daughter back her house or he will get her (“Chalk Writing”). Miss Trunchbull runs from the school screaming and the children celebrate their freedom ('Revolting Children').At the library, Miss Honey and Mrs. Phelps relay the aftermath of the events. A few days after Miss Trunchbull ran away, Miss Honey's parents' will has been found; they left all their money and their house to her. Miss Trunchbull is never seen again and Miss Honey becomes the new headmistress of the school. Matilda cannot use her powers again and Miss Honey is sad that a child who has helped others this way is stuck in an unloving home. The Wormwoods arrive at the library in a panic, telling Matilda that she must leave with them because they are fleeing to Spain. The wealthy Russians Mr. Wormwood was dealing with are the Russian Mafia, who are unhappy about being sold broken cars. Miss Honey asks if Matilda can stay with her, but the mafia arrive before a decision can be made. Sergei, the head of the Mafia, is impressed and moved by Matilda's intellect and respect, and he agrees not to harm the Wormwoods providing he never has to deal with Mr. Wormwood again ('This Little Girl Reprise'). Mr. Wormwood agrees to let Matilda live with Miss Honey. ('When I Grow Up Reprise')","The story starts with the chorus. We see a pregnant woman comes to the hospital and gives birth to a girl.

Spring Awakening,"  Act I Wendla Bergmann, an adolescent in late 19th-century Germany, laments that her mother gave her ""no way to handle things"" and has not taught her the lessons she is meant to know as a young woman (""Mama Who Bore Me""). She tells her mother that it is time she learned where babies come from, considering that she is about to be an aunt for the second time. Her mother cannot bring herself to explain the facts about conception clearly to Wendla, despite knowing her daughter is reaching puberty. Instead, she simply tells Wendla that to conceive a child a woman must love her husband with all of her heart. The other young girls in town – Martha, Thea, Anna and Ilse – appear to be similarly naïve and are upset about the lack of knowledge presented to them (""Mama Who Bore Me"" (Reprise)).At school, some teenage boys are studying Virgil in Latin class. When Moritz Stiefel, a very nervous and anxious young man, sleepily misquotes a line, the teacher chastises him harshly. Moritz’s classmate, the rebellious and highly intelligent Melchior Gabor, tries to defend him, but the teacher will have none of it, and hits Melchior with a stick. Melchior reflects on the shallow narrow-mindedness of school and society and expresses his intent to change things (""All That's Known"").Moritz describes a dream that has been keeping him up at night, and Melchior realizes that Moritz has been having erotic dreams which Moritz believes are signs of insanity. To comfort the panicked Moritz, Melchior, who has learned sexual information from books, tells Moritz that all of the boys at their age get these dreams. Moritz, Melchior and the other boys – Ernst, Hänschen, Otto and Georg – share their own sexually frustrated thoughts and desires (""The Bitch of Living""). Moritz, who is not comfortable talking about the subject with Melchior, requests that he give him the information in the form of an essay, complete with illustrations.All the girls, save Ilse, are gathered together after school and tease each other as they fantasize about marrying the boys in the town. Martha admits that she has a crush on Moritz, but is made fun of by the other girls. At the top of the list is the radical, intelligent, and good-looking Melchior (""My Junk""). Moritz has eagerly digested the essay that Melchior prepared for him, but complains that his new knowledge has only made his dreams even more vivid and torturous. Melchior tries to calm and comfort his friend, but Moritz runs off in frustration. All of the boys and girls express their desires for physical intimacy (""Touch Me"").Searching for flowers for her mother, Wendla stumbles upon Melchior. The two reminisce on the friendship they once shared as children and share a moment while sitting together in front of a tree. Each of them considers what it would be like to give in to their physical desires for one another (""The Word of Your Body""), but they do not do so. Meanwhile, at school, Moritz sneaks a look at his test results and is thrilled to learn that he has passed his midterm examinations, and tells the other boys. They are ecstatic, save the skeptical Hänschen.  However, the teacher and schoolmaster, who claim they cannot pass everyone, decide to fail Moritz anyway, deeming his passing grade still not up to the school's lofty standards.Martha accidentally admits to her friends that her father abuses her physically and sexually and that her mother is either oblivious or uncaring. The other girls are horrified to hear this, but Martha makes them promise not to tell anyone, lest she end up like Ilse, a friend from childhood who now wanders homeless and aimless after her similarly abusive parents kicked her out of the house (""The Dark I Know Well""). Later, Wendla finds Melchior again at his spot in the woods and tells him about Martha's abuse. Melchior is appalled to hear this, but Wendla convinces him to hit her with a switch, so that she can try to understand Martha’s pain. At first Melchior is determined to do nothing of the sort, but reluctantly complies. He gets carried away in the beating, taking his own frustrations out on Wendla and throws her to the ground. Disgusted with himself, Melchior runs off as Wendla is left lying on the ground, weeping. Alone, Wendla finds that Melchior has left his journal on the ground. She picks it up and takes it with her.Moritz is told he has failed his final examination, and his father reacts with disdain and contempt when Moritz tells him that he will not progress in school. Rather than attempting to understand his son's pain, Moritz's father is only concerned with how the others in town will react when they see ""the man with the son who failed."" Moritz writes to Melchior’s mother, his only adult friend, asking for money to help him flee to America; she tenderly but firmly denies his request and promises to write his parents to discourage them from being too hard on him (""And Then There Were None""). Devastated by her refusal, and feeling he has few choices left, Moritz contemplates suicide.In a stuffy hayloft during a storm, Melchior expresses his frustration about being caught between childhood and adulthood (""The Mirror-Blue Night""). Wendla finds him once again, telling him she wants to return his journal, and each apologizes for what happened in the forest. Melchior, disappointed in himself from the night before, urges her to leave. Wendla ignores this, instead suggesting they run in the rain until they ""get soaked to the skin"". Before long, they begin to kiss. Both of them nervous, they continue to entangle themselves and then hesitate – sensing that what they are doing is something very powerful. Wendla is not entirely sure of what they are about to do but is certain that it is unlike anything that she has known before. They continue and then have sex in the hayloft; as Melchior penetrates her, Wendla cries out (""I Believe""). (Note: This scene was slightly softened from the show's Off-Broadway run, where consent from Wendla was a bit more ambiguous. Later, as staged by the Broadway show, Wendla gives explicit consent to Melchior, but does so without full understanding of what they are going to do.) Act II Wendla and Melchior are finishing their moment of confused intimacy in the hayloft; they reflect on and discuss what has just happened (""The Guilty Ones"". In the Off-Broadway production, Act II began with ""There Once Was a Pirate"".)Moritz, having been thrown out of his home, wanders the town at dusk, carrying a pistol when he comes across Ilse, a childhood friend of his. Ilse, who it is implied has feelings for Moritz, tells him she has found refuge at an artists' colony, and they reminisce in some childhood memories and ""remarkable times"". She invites him to come home with her and join her in sharing some more childhood memories, and maybe something more. Moritz refuses and Ilse does everything she can to change his mind (""Don't Do Sadness/Blue Wind""). After affirming to Ilse that he truly wished he could go with her, Moritz refuses and Ilse leaves – distraught and upset. Realizing that Ilse was his last chance to escape the fate he's set out for himself, Moritz quickly changes his mind and calls after her, but it is too late – she is gone. Alone and believing that he has nowhere to turn, Moritz shoots himself.At Moritz's funeral, each of the children drops a flower into his grave as Melchior laments the passing of his friend while touching on the factors that led to his death, including the way his parents treated him (""Left Behind"").Back at school, the schoolmaster and teacher feel the need to call attention away from Moritz, whose death was a direct result of their actions.  They search through Moritz's belongings and find the essay on sex which Melchior wrote for him. They seize the opportunity to lay the blame of Moritz's death on Melchior, and although Melchior knows that he is not to blame, he knows there is nothing he can do to fight them and is expelled as a result (""Totally Fucked"").Elsewhere that night, Hänschen meets up with his shy and delicate classmate Ernst. Ernst tells Hänschen about his plans to become a pastor after school, and Hänschen shares his pragmatic outlook on life. He is amazed with how Ernst has remained so innocent despite the horrible things happening around them. They kiss and Ernst reveals that he loves Hänschen. (""The Word of Your Body (Reprise)"").Wendla has become ill, and her mother takes her to visit a doctor. He gives her some medication and assures them both that Wendla is suffering from anemia and will be fine, but takes Wendla's mother aside and tells her that Wendla is pregnant. When her mother confronts her with this information, Wendla is completely shocked, not understanding how it could have happened. She realizes that her mother lied to her about how babies are made. Although she berates her mother for leaving her ignorant, her mother rejects the guilt and insists Wendla tell her who the child's father is. Wendla reluctantly surrenders a passionate note Melchior sent her after they consummated their relationship.  She reflects somberly on her current condition and the circumstances that precipitated it, but resolves with optimism about her future child (""Whispering""). Meanwhile, Melchior's parents argue about their son's fate; his mother does not believe that the essay he wrote for Moritz is sufficient reason to send him away to reform school. When Melchior's father (Callum) tells his wife about Wendla's pregnancy, she finally agrees that they must send Melchior away, which they do without telling him that Wendla is pregnant.During this time, Melchior and Wendla keep contact through letters, delivered by Ilse. At the reform school, Melchior gets into a fight with some boys who grab a letter he has just received from Wendla and use it in a masturbation game. As one of the boys reads from the letter, Melchior finally learns about Wendla and their child, and he escapes from the institution to find her. Meanwhile, a very terrified and clueless Wendla is taken to a back-alley abortionist by her mother.When Melchior reaches town after a few days, he sends a message to Ilse, asking her to have Wendla meet him at the cemetery at midnight. Ilse, however, can take no action, as Melchior ""hasn't heard"" about Wendla. She shows Anna, Martha, and Thea the letter. They are equally horrified, and decide not to tell Melchior what has happened. At the cemetery, Melchior stumbles across Moritz's grave and swears to himself that he and Wendla will raise their child in a compassionate and open environment. When Wendla is late to the meeting, Melchior begins to feel a little uneasy. Looking around, Melchior sees a fresh grave he had not noticed before. He reads the name on the stone – Wendla's – and realizes that Wendla has died after a botched abortion. Overwhelmed by shock and grief, he takes out a razor with intent to kill himself. Moritz's and Wendla's spirits rise from their graves to offer him strength. They persuade him to journey on, and he resolves to live and to carry their memories with him forever (""Those You've Known"").Led by Ilse, everyone assembles onstage now (in some stagings, wearing modern clothes) to sing about how although the adults may still call the shots with their uptight and conservative views, they will not last forever, and the seeds are already being planted for a new, liberal minded, progressive generation (""The Song of Purple Summer"").","In the end of the XIX century, young Wendla began to think about how the children are born. Her mother said that the child is born in people who love each other wholeheartedly. Subject of intimacy excited all adolescents of the local city. One fellow even made to his friend essay of erotic nature, so that he could better understand his dreams. Girls are discussing the possibility of marriage with young fellows to make a list of the most interesting candidates. When they learned that Martha likes Moritz, the others laughed at her. When Wendla went into the woods for flowers, there she met her childhood friend Melchior. Young people realized that their bodies have changed significantly. But they did not dare to admit their interest in this issue.  Moritz made his way to school – he wanted to know in advance the results of examinations. The young man thought his score would be enough to continue his education, but teachers decided otherwise. Martha accidentally told her friends that her father forced her to cohabit. When Wendla met Melchior again in the woods, a girl told him about the tragedy of a friend. The young man was shocked. She asked to hit her – Wendla wanted to understand the pain of Martha. Yielding to the entreaties, Melchior fulfilled the desire of a girl. Angered then on himself, he ran out of the forest and lost his diary. Wendla took this notebook with her. Father of Moritz was greatly disappointed that his son has become a looser. The young man tried to get help from the mother of Melchior, with whom he was friends, but the woman refused to send him money for the trip to the New World. Moritz for the first time thought about suicide.  Being in the hayloft, Melchior complained of his life – his childhood has gone, and the adulthood has not yet arrived. Wendla soon found the boy and gave him his diary back. After the kiss, relationship of a young couple moved into a more intimate plane, although a girl did not think to go this far. After discussing what happened, guy and a girl felt guilty. Father chased Moritz away, and now the young man wandered through the city with a gun in his hand. He met there his childhood friend. It was a girl and she was kicked out of the house, after it became known that her father forced her to cohabit. She told about the shelter, which she found in the artists' colony, and called Moritz with her. At first, the young man refused the offer, but when the young man decided to follow her, she was no longer there. Not finding a girl, Moritz fell into despair and committed suicide. After the funeral, the teacher found in his belongings the essay of Melchior and the latter was accused in the death of a friend.  When Wendla fell ill, mother went with her to the doctor. It soon became clear that a girl was pregnant. Learning of this, shocked Wendla said – mother misinformed her, not telling the truth about the child's conception. When parents of Melchior learned of the deeds of their son, they’ve decided to send him to correctional school. When the boy started a fight with other adolescents, they took from him Wendla’s letter. After reading it aloud, bullies made Melchior aware of the pregnancy of a girl. Soon he has escaped. After returning home, the boy asked Ilse to tell Wendla, that he would wait for her at night in the cemetery. She understood that Melchior did not know anything about what have happened. But she did not dare to tell him the truth. At the cemetery, a young man saw near the grave of Moritz another burial. On the tombstone was Wendla’s name – she died during an abortion. Only ghosts of friend and beloved, who had risen from their graves, saved Melchior from suicide. The young man decided to continue to live and to remember those who were dear to him."
Avenue Q," The show is set on a fictional street in an ""outer-outer borough"" of New York City. Act I Princeton, a recent college graduate, is anxious to discover his purpose in life; but first, he must find an apartment and a job, with no work experience and an English degree (""What Do You Do with a B.A. in English?""). Beginning his search on Avenue A, he finally finds an affordable apartment on Avenue Q.  His new neighbors are Kate Monster, a kindergarten assistant teacher; Rod, an anal-retentive Republican banker; Nicky, Rod's slacker roommate; Brian, an aspiring comedian recently laid off from his day job; Christmas Eve, Brian's Japanese fiancée and a therapist with no clients; Trekkie Monster, a surly recluse who surfs the Internet all day in search of porn; and Gary Coleman, the building superintendent. Debates ensue over whose life sucks the most (""It Sucks to Be Me""), though they do conclude that Coleman's life sucks the most.Nicky, who is straight, suspects that Rod is gay, and assures Rod it is okay with him if he is; but Rod insists he is not (""If You Were Gay""). Princeton finds a lucky penny and longs to discover his purpose in life (""Purpose""). Kate dreams of starting a ""Monstersori"" school for young ""people of fur"".  Princeton innocently asks Kate if she and Trekkie are related, since they are both monsters, but Kate angrily pronounces his assumption racist. Princeton, taken aback, counters that Kate's Monstersori School would discriminate against non-monsters. They and the neighbors agree that racism is an adult reality (""Everyone's a Little Bit Racist"").Princeton receives money from his parents. The Bad Idea Bears, two charming troublemakers, convince him to spend it on beer. Kindergarten teacher Mrs. Thistletwat assigns Kate to teach the next morning's kindergarten class, her first solo teaching opportunity. She decides that her lesson will be about the Internet and all its educational attributes, but Trekkie Monster and the neighbors explain another reality of adulthood: Lots of adults, even ""normal people"", use it to find pornography (""The Internet is for Porn"").Princeton gives Kate a mixtape. His song selections are puzzling, making her wonder what message he is trying to send, but eventually, she decides that he must like her (""Mixtape""). Sure enough, he invites her on a date to the Around the Clock Café. Brian, the café's MC, does his raunchy stand-up act (""I'm Not Wearing Underwear Today""). He then introduces Lucy the Slut, a skanky chanteuse who wows the guys, especially Princeton, with a seductive cabaret number (""Special""). The Bad Idea Bears suggest that Kate and Princeton order some ""harmless"" Long Island Iced Teas, and once Kate is totally inebriated, Princeton takes her home to bed.Kate and Princeton have enthusiastic, high-decibel sex. Gary fields angry calls from other tenants but refuses to intercede (""You Can Be as Loud as the Hell You Want When You're Makin' Love""). Meanwhile, Rod hears Nicky say, ""I love you, Rod,"" in his sleep, and is jubilant – but eventually realises it was he who was dreaming. Kate and Princeton profess their mutual love, and Princeton gives Kate his lucky penny (""Fantasies Come True"").The next morning, a hung-over Kate oversleeps and misses her teaching assignment. Mrs. Thistletwat berates her, and Kate angrily quits her job before she can be fired. Christmas Eve decides unilaterally that it is time she and Brian were married. At the wedding, Nicky blurts out his suspicion that Rod is gay. Rod, furious, insists he has a girlfriend named Alberta in Vancouver (""My Girlfriend Who Lives in Canada"") and tells Nicky he is no longer welcome in their apartment.When Kate catches Christmas Eve's wedding bouquet, Princeton panics, confesses a fear of commitment, and asks Kate if they can just be friends. Kate retorts that she already has plenty of friends, and breaks off their relationship (""There's a Fine, Fine Line""). Act II A despondent Princeton has been holed up in his apartment after breaking up with Kate but is coaxed out by the neighbors (""There is Life Outside Your Apartment""). Lucy is looking for a place to crash and seduces the rebounding Princeton. Kate is angry, but Christmas Eve explains that she would not be angry if she were not in love with him (""The More You Ruv Someone""). Kate writes a note to Princeton suggesting that they rendezvous at the Empire State Building and leaves it with Lucy who promptly destroys it.  A homeless Nicky laments his fate to Gary who confesses that he is deriving pleasure from Nicky's misfortune (""Schadenfreude"").On the Empire State Building's viewing platform, Kate, thinking that Princeton has stood her up, throws his lucky penny away. A hundred stories below, Lucy, walking by on Fifth Avenue, is knocked unconscious by the penny. Kate and Princeton unsuccessfully try to work out their problems over Lucy's comatose body. Rod is too proud to accept Nicky's repeated apologies, despite clearly missing him, and tearfully consults Christmas Eve. Princeton, Kate, and Nicky dream of returning to happier times (""I Wish I Could Go Back to College"").Princeton gives a still-homeless panhandling Nicky a quarter, and marvels at how fantastic he feels. Since thinking only about himself has gotten him nowhere, he decides to raise money to build Kate's Monstersori School. He solicits everyone, even breaking the fourth wall to shake down the audience, but results are disappointing (""The Money Song""). Then Trekkie Monster, recalling his own traumatic school experiences, donates ten million dollars – and explains to the astonished cast, ""In volatile market, only stable investment is porn!"" (""School for Monsters/The Money Song (Reprise)"").Kate joyfully opens her new school. Brian lands a consulting job, and Christmas Eve finally has a paying client (Rod), so the newlyweds move to a better neighborhood. Rod finally comes out, to no one's particular surprise, and takes Nicky back in. Nicky finds Rod a boyfriend – Ricky, a muscle-bound hunk who otherwise looks and sounds exactly like Nicky. The Bad Idea Bears discover Scientology. Lucy, recovered from her head injury, becomes a born-again Christian and takes a vow of chastity. Kate and Princeton agree to give their relationship another go (""There's a Fine, Fine Line (Reprise)"").A new college graduate inquires about the vacancy in the building, (""What Do You Do with a B.A. in English (Reprise)"") and Princeton has an epiphany: maybe his purpose is to put everything he has learned into a Broadway musical. Everybody, especially the new guy, immediately ridicules him. The cast reminds Princeton that, in the real world, many people never find their purpose, but life goes on, and everything, both good and bad, is ""only for now."" (""For Now"").","A new person comes to a large city, which, of course, have his own dreams of life and he seeks to implement them. After moving for living in the suitable living block, he meets the very lively characters who are as if a small representative sample of all society. One of them starts to talk to him about gays, and the second – about racism. The longer it goes, the tighter it becomes.  The events that begin then, cannot be called a whirlpool, but still quite reasonably interesting – one of the girls living in the house trying to seduce one of her neighbors, but as he refuses she considers this impossible. Another couple began to play the game with alcohol – whether on the strip, or simply for the sake of an interesting prelude – and it all ends with the act of coitus, eventually. Which affects that later this woman got fired from her job because she missed it without appropriate reasons.  Because of charging one of the characters in his non-traditional gender orientation, he becomes furiously mad, arguing the opposite (too explicit denial indicates not groundless assumptions of others about the topic). While some others decide to get married. And another couple of neighbors – to get apart.  Bright moment, filled with pity about the childhood occurs when the rich Trekkie Monster gives in impulse of the act of charity as much as USD 10 million that a school for monsters was built. After all, he was often teased at a regular school and because of it now he wants that other creations, looking not similar to another, were among their own kind, not being teased.  This play ends that a school for monsters begins to build, and someone finds his vocation (which emphasized with the song “For Now”).  Yes – and the majority of the persons involved – are puppet monsters akin to ones played in various productions, like Muppet Show or Sesame Street, who was led by puppeteers, and latter give them extra emotions."
In the Heights,"  Act 1 As the sun rises on the hottest day of the summer, Usnavi de la Vega, the owner of a small bodega in Washington Heights, chases away a small-time vandal, Graffiti Pete, before introducing the audience to the corner he lives on and some of its many residents: Abuela Claudia, a matriarchal figure who helped to raise Usnavi among others; Usnavi's young, lazy cousin Sonny who helps run the bodega; Daniela and Carla, who run the local salon; and Kevin and Camila Rosario, who run the cab company (“In the Heights”). As the day begins, the Rosarios’ daughter Nina arrives home from her first year at Stanford University. Often considered the “one who made it out” and the pride of the corner, Nina dreads telling her parents and neighbors the truth of her return home: that she dropped out of Stanford because she had to work two jobs to maintain her tuition, leading to her getting poor grades and losing her scholarship (“Breathe”). As she tries to find her parents to tell them the news, she runs into Benny, Usnavi's best friend and an employee of Kevin's who has been temporarily left in charge of the dispatch while Kevin seeks to solve a financial problem. Clearly harboring latent romantic feelings for one another, Benny and Nina reconnect (“Benny’s Dispatch”). Elsewhere, Vanessa, an employee of Daniela's at the salon (and with whom Usnavi had long been infatuated), dreams of one day leaving the corner and getting an apartment in the West Village (“It Won’t Be Long Now”). While she is on a break at the salon, Sonny asks her out on a date on Usnavi's behalf, and she accepts; Usnavi rejoices at his success but worries that Vanessa may forget about him and the rest of the community when she moves.Nina reunites with her parents and is ultimately forced to reveal that she dropped out. Her parents are stunned at this revelation (as well as her dishonesty) and Kevin grows devastated that he has been unable to provide for his family, fearing that he has continued the cycle started by his deadbeat father (“Inútil”). Nina escapes to the salon to seek comfort from Vanessa, but Daniela and Carla insist on giving her a makeover and subjecting her to their gossip about the goings-on in the neighborhood, specifically about Nina and Vanessa's respective love interests (“No Me Diga”). The attention turns once more to Nina and her successes, however, forcing Nina to reveal the truth once more about Stanford and leave exasperatedly.As Usnavi closes up shop, he, Benny, Sonny, and Graffiti Pete discover that the bodega has sold a winning lottery ticket worth $96,000. They and soon the rest of the block begin to fantasize about what they would do if they won the small fortune (“96,000”). As the excitement dies down, Abuela Claudia sits down to feed the birds and reminisces about her childhood in Cuba and her life in relative poverty, and the events that have led her to where she is today. With tears of gratitude, she reveals that she holds the winning lottery ticket, and thanks her years of patience and faith for bringing her this fortune (“Paciencia y Fe”). Elsewhere, Nina finds solace in Benny, who takes her on a walk down the street corner and reminisces with her, reminding her of her childhood and her home. Nina expresses her doubts about her own self-worth to Benny, but he reassures her that she is destined for greatness (“When You’re Home”). As they head to Nina's house for dinner, the local Piragua Guy continues his day selling piraguas through the intense heat and competing with Mister Softee (“Piragua”).Kevin and Camila host Nina, Benny, Usnavi, Vanessa, and Abuela Claudia for dinner where Kevin makes an announcement: he has sold the car service to pay for Nina's tuition. Nina and Camila are shocked but Benny, who had long dreamed of taking over the car service, is outraged and confronts Kevin over his decision. Kevin insists that Rosario's is a family business and that Benny will never be family; Benny subsequently leaves in a huff and Nina, refusing to accept the money, follows him out. Usnavi soon arrives at a local club for his date with Vanessa, but is overly nervous and aloof, leading Vanessa to dance with other guys to make him jealous; Usnavi soon finds his own dance partner and tries to make Vanessa jealous in turn. Nina follows Benny to the club to apologize for her father's decision but Benny, already drunk, angrily brushes her off (“The Club”). Tensions rise in the club as the two couples cope with their own jealousy, culminating in Benny punching a man dancing with Nina, causing a fight to break out. Suddenly, the power goes out throughout the city as a result of the intense heat and humidity. The neighborhood descends into chaos as Usnavi and Vanessa, as well as Benny and Nina, desperately try to find their way back to one another. Sonny and Graffiti Pete, fearing looters, set off fireworks to distract potential robbers as well as to light everyone else's way home. Usnavi reunites with Abuela Claudia, who shows him her lottery winnings, and Benny and Nina find each other amid the chaos, and despite initially arguing, they finally kiss (“Blackout”). Act 2 Nina and Benny spend the night together in Benny's apartment as Kevin frantically searches for her all night; Benny worries what Kevin will say about their relationship but is happy to finally be with her (“Sunrise”). Down the street, Usnavi, whose bodega has in fact been looted, convenes with Abuela Claudia to discuss what will happen with the money. Abuela Claudia decides to give Sonny and Usnavi each a third of the money and urges Usnavi to use it to achieve his lifelong dream of returning to his home in the Dominican Republic. While Usnavi shares some doubts, he eventually decides to go (“Hundreds of Stories”). Nina eventually returns home to find her parents worried sick about her, and Kevin grows furious when he learns she was with Benny, disapproving of their relationship due to Benny's not being Latino. Nina and Kevin loudly argue before Camila intervenes, criticizing both Kevin for throwing Benny out and Nina for not coming home. She urges them to come together and work things out as a family (“Enough”).As the neighborhood copes with their frustration over the heat and blackout, Daniela urges them to dispel the negativity and muster up enough energy for a neighborhood celebration. As the block reluctantly begins making the most of a bad situation, Daniela leads the crowd in mocking Vanessa for not realizing Usnavi's feelings for her as well as Benny for his tryst with Nina the previous night. Usnavi soon emerges and announces Abuela Claudia's winning of the lottery as well as their flight for the Dominican Republic the following day. Vanessa is visibly upset by his leaving, and so is Sonny, who has long had a crush on Nina and whose only close relative is Usnavi. Usnavi calms Sonny down by revealing that they plan to give him a third of the lottery winnings and begins to rouse excitement throughout the block once more by encouraging them to celebrate before everything changes (“Carnaval del Barrio”).As they continue dancing and celebrating, a visibly upset Nina arrives and pulls Usnavi offstage, and soon Kevin makes an announcement over the dispatch: Abuela Claudia has suddenly died (“Atención”). Usnavi holds an impromptu memorial for Abuela Claudia, revealing that she died of “a combination of the stress and heat,” and soon Nina leads the entire block in singing Abuela's praises (“Alabanza”). Afterward, Usnavi and Nina go through Abuela's old photographs to reminisce. Nina begins to remember the central role Abuela Claudia played in her education and motivation, and in memory of Abuela, she resolves to accept her parents’ money and give college another try, returning to Stanford at the end of the summer (“Everything I Know”). As Vanessa prepares to move out, Daniela gives her a final piece of news: Usnavi convinced Daniela to cosign Vanessa's lease for her new apartment (“No Me Diga (Reprise)”). As the blackout continues, the Piragua Guy rejoices in the effect the heat has had on his business (“Piragua (Reprise)”).Overwhelmed by his kind act, Vanessa visits a flustered Usnavi as he cleans up the bodega and flirts with him, offering him a bottle of champagne. She quietly suggests to the distracted Usnavi that he should stay in the neighborhood, worried that if he leaves that she will never see him again, but Usnavi, overwhelmed, firmly rejects this. Vanessa kisses him before leaving, lamenting that she was too late in realizing her feelings for him (“Champagne”). As Nina tells Benny of her decision, they agree to spend the summer together before pursuing a long-distance relationship when she returns to school; Benny reaffirms his faith in her and they promise to think of one another every day while they are apart (“When The Sun Goes Down”). Benny confronts Kevin for a final time, insisting that he was always there for him while Kevin never did the same. As the night winds down, Sonny approaches Graffiti Pete with a secret proposition, which Pete accepts.The next morning the neighborhood has visibly changed: the car service sign over the Rosarios’ building has been removed and the grate in front of the bodega is still open. As Usnavi plays Abuela Claudia's old records, he comes to terms with the fact that the corner is about to change, and wonders if anyone will notice that he's gone in the long run. Before he leaves, Sonny approaches him and, having fixed the bodega's grate, pulls it down, revealing a graffiti mural of Abuela Claudia painted by Pete. Seeing the mural, Usnavi has an epiphany and tasks Sonny and Graffiti Pete with telling the neighborhood of his decision to stay. As he reflects on his role as the neighborhood's storyteller, Usnavi ponders a potential future with Vanessa as he strives to ensure that his family's legacy is remembered and accepts the corner as his true home (“Finale”).","It is the morning of summer day.

But the prince turns her away solely for her appearance. The old woman warns him not to be fooled by appearances, as true beauty lies within, only to be rejected again. She then transforms into a beautiful enchantress and turns the prince into a hideous Beast and his servants into various household objects. She gives him the rose to use as an hour-glass. The only way he can break the spell is to learn to love another and earn her love in return by the time the last petal falls (""Prologue"").Ten years later, a beautiful young girl named Belle makes her way into town one morning in order to get a book from the local bookseller.

The King and I,"  Act 1 In 1862, a strong-willed, widowed schoolteacher, Anna Leonowens, arrives in Bangkok, Siam (later known as Thailand) at the request of the King of Siam to tutor his many children.  Anna's young son, Louis, fears the severe countenance of the King's prime minister, the Kralahome, but Anna refuses to be intimidated (""I Whistle a Happy Tune""). The Kralahome has come to escort them to the palace, where they are expected to live – a violation of Anna's contract, which calls for them to live in a separate house.  She considers returning to Singapore aboard the vessel that brought them, but goes with her son and the Kralahome.Several weeks pass, during which Anna and Louis are confined to their palace rooms.  The King receives a gift from the king of Burma, a lovely slave girl named Tuptim, to be one of his many wives.  She is escorted by Lun Tha, a scholar who has come to copy a design for a temple, and the two are secretly in love.  Tuptim, left alone, declares that the King may own her, but not her heart (""My Lord and Master"").  The King gives Anna her first audience. The schoolteacher is a part of his plan for the modernization of Siam; he is impressed when she already knows this.  She raises the issue of her house with him, he dismisses her protests and orders her to talk with his wives.  They are interested in her, and she tells them of her late husband, Tom (""Hello, Young Lovers"").  The King presents her new pupils; Anna is to teach those of his children whose mothers are in favor with him – several dozen – and is to teach their mothers as well.  The princes and princesses enter in procession (""March of the Royal Siamese Children"").  Anna is charmed by the children, and formality breaks down after the ceremony as they crowd around her.Anna has not given up on the house, and teaches the children proverbs and songs extolling the virtues of home life, to the King's irritation.  The King has enough worries without battling the schoolteacher, and wonders why the world has become so complicated (""A Puzzlement"").  The children and wives are hard at work learning English (""The Royal Bangkok Academy"").  The children are surprised by a map showing how small Siam is compared with the rest of the world (""Getting to Know You"").  As the crown prince, Chulalongkorn, disputes the map, the King enters a chaotic schoolroom.  He orders the pupils to believe the teacher but complains to Anna about her lessons about ""home"".  Anna stands her ground and insists on the letter of her contract, threatening to leave Siam, much to the dismay of wives and children.  The King orders her to obey as ""my servant""; she repudiates the term and hurries away.  The King dismisses school, then leaves, uncertain of his next action. Meanwhile, Lun Tha comes upon Tuptim, and they muse about having to hide their relationship (""We Kiss in a Shadow"").In her room, Anna replays the confrontation in her mind, her anger building (""Shall I Tell You What I Think of You?"").  Lady Thiang, the King's head wife, tells Anna that the King is troubled by his portrayal in the West as a barbarian, as the British are being urged to take over Siam as a protectorate.  Anna is shocked by the accusations – the King is a polygamist, but he is no barbarian – but she is reluctant to see him after their argument.  Lady Thiang convinces her that the King is deserving of support (""Something Wonderful"").  Anna goes to him and finds him anxious for reconciliation.  The King tells her that the British are sending an envoy to Bangkok to evaluate the situation.  Anna ""guesses"" – the only guise in which the King will accept advice – that the King will receive the envoy in European style, and that the wives will be dressed in Western fashion.  Tuptim has been writing a play based on a book that Anna has lent her, Uncle Tom's Cabin, that can be presented to the guests.  News is brought to the King that the British are arriving much earlier than thought, and so Anna and the wives are to stay up all night to prepare.  The King assembles his family for a Buddhist prayer for the success of the venture and also promises before Buddha that Anna will receive her own house ""as provided in agreement, etc., etc."" Act 2 The wives are dressed in their new European-style gowns, which they find confining (""Western People Funny"").  In the rush to prepare, the question of undergarments has been overlooked, and the wives have practically nothing on underneath their gowns. When the British envoy, Sir Edward Ramsay, arrives and gazes at them through a monocle, they are panicked by the ""evil eye"" and lift their skirts over their heads as they flee. Sir Edward is diplomatic about the incident. When the King is called away, it emerges that Sir Edward is an old flame of Anna's, and they dance in remembrance of old times, as Edward urges her to return to British society. The King returns and irritably reminds them that dancing is for after dinner.As final preparations for the play are made, Tuptim steals a moment to meet with Lun Tha. He tells her he has an escape plan, and she should be ready to leave after the performance (""I Have Dreamed"").  Anna encounters them, and they confide in her (""Hello, Young Lovers"", reprise). The play (""Small House of Uncle Thomas"", narrated ballet) is presented in a Siamese ballet-inspired dance. Tuptim is the narrator, and she tells her audience of the evil King Simon of Legree and his pursuit of the runaway slave Eliza. Eliza is saved by Buddha, who miraculously freezes a river and conceals her in snow. Buddha then causes the river to melt, drowning King Simon and his hunting party.  The anti-slavery message is blunt.After the play, Sir Edward reveals that the British threat has receded, but the King is distracted by his displeasure at Tuptim's rebellious message. After Sir Edward leaves, Anna and the King express their delight at how well the evening went, and he presents her with a ring.  Secret police report that Tuptim is missing.  The King realizes that Anna knows something; she parries his inquiry by asking why he should care: Tuptim is just another woman to him. He is delighted; she is at last understanding the Siamese perspective. Anna tries to explain to him the Western customs of courtship and tells him what it is like for a young woman at a formal dance (""Shall We Dance?"").  He demands that she teach him the dance. She does, and in that dance they experience and express a love for each other that they can never speak aloud. They are interrupted by the Kralahome. Tuptim has been captured, and a search is on for Lun Tha. The King resolves to punish Tuptim, though she denies she and Lun Tha were lovers. Anna tries to dissuade him, but he is determined that her influence shall not rule, and he takes the whip himself. He turns to lash Tuptim, but under Anna's gaze is unable to swing the whip, and hurries away. Lun Tha is found dead, and Tuptim is dragged off, swearing to kill herself; nothing more is heard about her.  Anna asks the Kralahome to give her ring back to the King; both schoolteacher and minister state their wish that she had never come to Siam.Several months pass with no contact between Anna and the King.  Anna is packed and ready to board a ship leaving Siam.  Chulalongkorn arrives with a letter from the King, who has been unable to resolve the conflicts within himself and is dying.  Anna hurries to the King's bedside and they reconcile.  The King persuades her to take back the ring and to stay and assist the next king, Chulalongkorn.  The dying man tells Anna to take dictation from the prince, and instructs the boy to give orders as if he were King.  The prince orders the end of the custom of kowtowing that Anna hated.  The King grudgingly accepts this decision.  As Chulalongkorn continues, prescribing a less arduous bow to show respect for the king, his father dies.  Anna kneels by the late King, holding his hand and kissing it, as the wives and children bow or curtsey, a gesture of respect to old king and new.","How often do you think about the distant exotic countries? Where the air is saturated with musk and spices, where women bundled up in a weightless silks, and men are strict and harsh, with rigid smiles on the lips, ready to give own life away even in the slightest dispute. Of course, everyone has heard stories about Eastern habits and customs, but not everyone even though he could have imagine that.  Young and eccentric woman named Anna Leonuens together with her son goes to Siam. She received an official letter from the King of Siam named Mongkung, asking about teaching his children at the palace. Anna had been promised a separate house next to the palace, and a monthly salary of twenty pounds. Pretty prestigious for a young widow, whose life only begins anew. Anna is met by Prime Minister from the ship, and together they go to the palace to get acquainted with the King. Anna manages to catch in the reception hall Prince of Burma who sent the king young beautiful maiden named Thupten, as a gift. The minister wants to lead Anna away, but it does not work: a young girl rushes after the King, who, however, do not mind against it.  He introduces her to the female part of the palace and shows where she will live. Woman outraged with such an attitude and a violation of the promise, but the king convenes his children that surround Anna and become familiar with her. Charmed, future teacher agrees to live in the palace temporarily. Gradually, in the day of arrival, all the wives of the king and the new girl, Burmese Thupten, recently gifted to Mongkung, introduced with Anna. She learned a lot from these women about life in the palace and in general in this country. The next day Anna holds first lesson. Geography. A woman gets away the wrong map, the center of which is large Siam, surrounded by a little world, and hangs the correct, accurate map of the world. She tells the children about the wonders of the world: snowflakes falling from the sky; that you can walk on water when there is ice in the winter; about other countries. But the kids, seeing what Anna has made with the map, hearing the wonderful stories, do not believe the teacher and cease to listen and obey, but discipline instantly restores after arrival of the king.  He came to ask about the book, which he saw that Thupten has, his new wife, and Anna says it's ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"", which refers to the issue of slavery and abolitionism, and Anna strongly supports the ideas described in this book upfront of  the royal children. Anna is summoned by the king at night. After many debates, he tells her that he is considered a barbarian and going to be dethroned by the neighboring states, and asks her for help and advice, to bring back own good name.  Long trainings and work on oneself, the struggle between two completely different cultures, totally opposite to each other that two heroes face in their personalities on the way to a common purpose and understanding. And when it seemed that the goal about understanding is reached, turning into a good friendship, all interrupted by the only irreversible thing in the world. There was the death of the king. But Anna agrees to stay in Siam at the request of son of Mongkung, heir of the throne, to continue to teach children, as well as to give advices to the future king."
Mary Poppins,"  Act I Bert, a man of many professions, introduces the audience to Cherry Tree Lane (""Chim Chim Cher-ee/Cherry Tree Lane - Part 1"") in Edwardian London. Number 17 is where the Banks family lives: George and Winifred Banks, their two naughty children Jane and Michael, their cook/maid, Mrs. Brill and their house boy, Robertson Ay. Things are not going well for Jane and Michael. They are out of control and, as the show starts, their latest nanny, Katie Nanna, storms out. After that, Mrs. Brill and Robertson Ay complain about living in a ""madhouse."" The children decide to write the advertisement for a new nanny (""The Perfect Nanny""), but George, having a very different idea of what constitutes the perfect nanny, tears up the piece of paper and throws it in the fireplace. The family all reflect on if they will ever find the perfect nanny (""Cherry Tree Lane - Part 2""). Within moments, Mary Poppins arrives, restored advertisement in hand, and takes charge of the Banks children, having every confidence in her own qualifications and merits (""Practically Perfect"").On the children's first outing to the park, they meet Bert and, despite their reservations, Mary teaches them that they must learn to look past appearances. To illustrate the point, Mary brings the park statues, including a mythological figure named Neleus, to life (""Jolly Holiday""). A storm starts to brew and the children quickly hurry home, but not before Neleus mentions how much he misses his father.While Mary manages the children, other problems lie with their parents. Winifred is aware that she is somehow disappointing both her children and her husband. George, on the other hand, can't understand why she finds the role of wife and mother so difficult. In an effort to please her husband, Winifred sends out invitations for a smart tea party (""Cherry Tree Lane (Reprise) / Being Mrs. Banks / Jolly Holiday (Reprise)""). Mrs. Brill makes the preparations, while telling an eager Robertson Ay to keep his hands off. The children inadvertently sabotage the kitchen preparations, but Mary sorts it out with a lesson (""A Spoonful of Sugar""). However, it is then revealed that none of the invitees are coming and Winifred reflects on her failure at pleasing George (""A Spoonful Of Sugar (Reprise)"").Mary takes the children to visit their father at the bank where he works (""Precision and Order""). There, George is busy dealing with possible investment clients: firstly, an ambitious man named Herr Von Hussler with an elaborate money-making scheme, and then a middle-class man named John Northbrook with a simple factory project. George is furious when Mary turns up with the children, but an innocent question asked by Jane (What's more important, a good man or a good idea?) makes him realise how much his values have changed (""A Man Has Dreams"") since he was an idealistic young man. He then decides to accept Northbrook's project and rejects Von Hussler's, even though he knows the bank disapproves. Outside St. Paul's Cathedral, Mary introduces the children to the Bird Woman (""Feed the Birds""). Jane is suspicious of her, but Michael responds to the Bird Woman and throws crumbs for the birds. On the trip home, the children meet the enigmatic Mrs. Corry who runs a magic sweet shop that also sells words (""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"").The children return home in high spirits, unaware that things have gone wrong for their father. Unknown to them, George's decision to reject Von Hussler has cost the bank dearly, and he is suspended without pay. George explodes with rage at the children and they are sent to the nursery. Reacting to their father's outburst, Mary briefly points out that other members of the family are rarely there to take care of the parents, before Jane and Michael get into a fight over Jane's doll Valentine, prompting a displeased Mary to order them to bed and enchant them to sleep. The frightening consequence of Jane's anger becomes apparent moments afterwards, as Valentine and the rest of Jane and Michael's disgruntled toys come to life and join Mary in teaching them a lesson in how to take better care of their belongings and toys (formerly ""Temper, Temper"", now ""Playing the Game"").Believing that Jane and Michael need personal growth, Mary decides to leave Cherry Tree Lane (""Chim Chim Chimr-ee – Rooftop Duet""), to bring them to their senses. Her distraught charges find a note saying that perhaps they will see Mary again eventually. Jane and Michael wake up to find Mary Poppins and their toys gone, leaving only a note on the floor. It reads ""Dear Jane and Michael, keep playing the game. Au Revoir, Mary Poppins."" Mrs. Brill sees them awake and when asked about what Au Revoir means, she tells them that it means ""Till we meet again."" She sends them in for bed. Act II In a misguided attempt to please her husband, Winifred arranges for his childhood nanny, Miss Andrew, to take over from the suddenly departed Mary (""Cherry Tree Lane (Reprise)""). At the sight of her, a terrified George flees, exclaiming ""the Holy Terror!"" To everyone's shock and dismay, he is right. Miss Andrew is a brutal and cruel tyrant, quick to administer her own terrible elixir (""Brimstone and Treacle Part 1"") and discipline by threatening to split Jane by taking over her and Michael up through boarding school. After Miss Andrew leaves, Jane and Michael decide that running away is the only solution.The children find their good friend Bert, who cheers them up and helps Michael fulfill his dream of flying a kite (""Let's Go Fly a Kite""). Mary Poppins flies in on the kite from the sky and reunites with the children. They update her on Miss Andrews and she takes them home, planning to ""surprise"" Andrews.Also hiding in the park is George, who is depressed over his supposed lack of achievements (""Good For Nothing""). Searching for him is Winifred, who at last understands her husband and the damage that was done to him by Miss Andrew (""Being Mrs Banks (Reprise)"").When the children return to Number 17, Mary sets Caruso, Miss Andrew's lark, free from his cage. This leads to a confrontation between the two nannies, ending with Miss Andrew having a taste of her own medicine as she is trapped in a large birdcage and vanishes down below (""Brimstone and Treacle Part 2""). Winifred and then George return at this point, surprised but pleased that Miss Andrew has ""left"".On their next adventure, Bert introduces the children to his friends the chimney sweeps (""Step in Time""). The sweeps' dance eventually enters the house, causing chaos. As the sweeps quickly exit, George receives a telegram from the bank requesting his presence there. George assumes that it is to seal his fate and decides it's time to sell the family heirloom. However, the vase is shattered accidentally by Mrs. Brill, who goes into a despairing shock since she had been cleaning it from the top of the shelf. When she is being led away for comfort, George goes to clean the broken pile himself, to find it reveal a collection of gingerbread stars from his childhood. This leads to a brief moment of reflection for George (""A Man Has Dreams (Reprise) / A Spoonful Of Sugar (Reprise)""). After shaking hands with Bert, George leaves to meet the Chairman of the Bank.At the children's encouragement, Winifred decides to follow her heart and be at George's side at the bank (""Anything Can Happen (Part 1)""). Unseen to anyone else, Mary takes Jane and Michael into the sky to follow, where they watch the unfolding events. On his way to the bank, George encounters the bird woman and gives her tuppence to feed the birds (""Feed The Birds (Reprise)"")At the bank (""Precision And Order (Reprise)""), George is surprised to learn the consequence of his choice: far from ruining the bank, he has made a fortune by both rejecting Von Hussler and approving Mr. Northbrook's loan. They ask for the word that made them so successful, which George admits to be Mary's word, (""Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious (Reprise)""). Winifred, arriving to defend her husband, finds instead he is the hero of the hour. After she mentions Miss Andrew's name to the Bank Manager, the old man too relates his experience under ""the Holy Terror"". George apologizes for underestimating her, and together they return to the house. Mary and Bert take the children acorss the skies and they see everyone they met along their journey including Mrs. Correy, Neleus, and even Miss Andrews, who kindly shakes hands with Michael (""Anything Can Happen (Part 2)"").Mary realizes that with the family reunited and happy, her task is done. With regret, she says goodbye to Bert with a kiss on the cheek and sets off (A Spoonful Of Sugar (A Task Is Done)""). Jane and Michael accept that Mary is leaving them and tell her that they'll never forget her. The two children watch as their parents waltz happily together and Mary flies high above the audience.","The musical starts with an introduction of main characters and the place – Cherry Tree Lane.

It's time for Mary to leave them, but they will never forget their nanny."
Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat," The plot of the film follows the same story of Joseph's life as the West End musical. The only change is the addition of a very brief framing device in which the actors begin the film as ""teachers"" in a school where the ""students"" become the children's chorus of the musical.","Familiar to all from the very childhood biblical story about the wise Joseph, finds a second life on the stage. First, there is the narrator, who begins with the familiarization of the family of Joseph, father Jacob and his other twelve sons and their wives. Jacob distinguishes Joseph among other his children, and this, of course, cannot cause nothing else but jealousy among the other brothers, and among the last drops in the sea of ardent opposition becomes bright cloak that the father gives to his beloved son. This is a signal to brothers that it is time to get rid of Joseph.  Brothers caught Joseph, beaten him and sold into slavery to the Egyptians – slave traders, passing through their town and, pre-stained bright coat in the blood of the goat, showed it to Jacob. His son was killed, they said. And they go away in grief, so that after to celebrate the victory over the rival with their wives. Meanwhile, Joseph enters the home of a wealthy Egyptian. He works hard and deserves a high rank among other slaves, but one day the wife of a rich man offers Joseph to share her bed. He refuses, turning on himself the wrath of the scorned woman. In retaliation, woman complains to spouse, stipulating Joseph and accusing him in the attempt to steal her honor. Wrongly adjudged Jew is sent to prison.  There he meets two other slaves, servants of Pharaoh. Butler and baker were his neighbors. In the cramped and damp dungeon walls, they told to Jew their dreams, and Joseph explained to them wisely: butler will be forgiven, and the baker – executed. Predicting of his came true. Soon, rumors of a gift of Joseph reached the Pharaoh’s ears through the mouth of the butler, who heard that Pharaoh is suffered from the strange dreams. Joseph was told to come before the Pharaoh to solve the mystery of his dreams, what could not do other priests of Pharaoh. Joseph easily explained all the dreams of the ruler, receiving by this his mercy.  For many years Joseph helped the Pharaoh wisely govern the country, predicting tribulations and joys. Pharaoh appointed him to be vizier of Egypt and gave a daughter of one of his priests as his wife. Joseph predicted seven years of prosperity and fertility and the seven years of hunger and decline. And when hungry time came, the people of Egypt were ready thanks to him. The Jews, including Joseph's brothers, who betrayed him, was forced to ask for mercy from the Pharaoh and their brother. Joseph forgave his brothers and gave his people shelter and protection on the land of Egypt. Brothers, first quarreling out, found understanding and peace, and Joseph was able to excuse their cruelty. At the end, he appears in front of his father and puts on this bright cloak that Jacob kept for so many years in memory of his son."
Mamma Mia!,"  Act I Before the curtain rises, the orchestra starts playing the overture, which is a montage of instrumental versions of some of ABBA's hit songs.On the fictional Greek island of Kalokairi (Skopelos), 20-year-old Sophie is preparing to marry her fiancé, Sky. She wants her father to walk her down the aisle (""Prologue"") but doesn't know who he is. Sophie discovers her mother's old diary and finds entries which describe intimate dates with three men (Sam Carmichael, Bill Austin [Anderson in the film version], and Harry Bright) (""Honey, Honey"").  Sophie believes one of these men is her father and, three months before her nuptials, sends each an invitation to her wedding, writing in her mother's name, Donna, without letting her unsuspecting mother know.Donna begins receiving guests at her taverna. The first to arrive are her long-time best friends, Tanya, a rich woman who has been married and divorced three times, and Rosie, an unmarried, carefree woman. The trio used to comprise a girl group called ""Donna and the Dynamos"". The three women catch up and talk about their lives (""Money, Money, Money"").Later that day, Sophie's three possible fathers arrive: Sam (an American architect), Harry (a British banker), and Bill (originally an Australian writer and adventurer, Swedish in the film, and currently American in New York and on tour). Sophie convinces them not to tell Donna that she invited them (""Thank You for the Music""). Donna is surprised to see her ex-lovers (""Mamma Mia"") and leaves in tears. Donna, crying, explains to Tanya and Rosie the situation, and they cheer her up (""Chiquitita""). Tanya and Rosie try to convince Donna that she can still be the girl she once was (""Dancing Queen"").Sophie had hoped she would know her father the moment she saw him but is now only confused. She tries to tell her fiancé, Sky, how she feels without confessing what she has done. Sky tells her he will be the only man she ever needs (""Lay All Your Love on Me"").At Sophie's hen party, Donna and the Dynamos don their old costumes and perform a song, (""Super Trouper""). Sam, Bill, and Harry accidentally walk in on the party, and the guests persuade them to stay (""Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight)"").Sophie first pulls Sam out of the room to talk to him. After he asks why he is there, she is overcome with guilt and goes to talk to Harry, instead. But Harry asks if Sophie's father is at the party, and she tells him the whole truth.Lastly, she draws Bill aside to talk with him. She learns that Bill has an aunt Sophia who left all her money to Donna's family. Bill learns that Donna built the taverna with money she inherited from a friend she lived with when Sophie was a baby; that friend was Bill's aunt. They both think this means he is her father.Sophie asks Bill to walk her down the aisle, but Bill wants to discuss it first with Donna. This has been her secret, after all. But no one knows yet that even Donna doesn't know who the father is, because she slept with the three men in such swift succession. Sophie insists they mustn't tell Donna anything (""The Name of the Game"") and finally, Bill agrees.Afterward, everybody crashes the hen party (including the guys from the stag party). During the party, Sam pulls Sophie aside and tells her he has figured out why she invited him. He knows he is her father and promises to walk her down the aisle the next day. Then, Harry approaches Sophie, apologizing for being so slow on the uptake; he is also convinced that she is his daughter and promises to walk her down the aisle. Sophie leaves the party, hopelessly confused; she doesn't want to turn any of them down (""Voulez-Vous""). Act II (Entr'acte) Sophie's having a nightmare, involving her three possible fathers all fighting for the right to walk her down the aisle and wakes up despairing (""Under Attack"").Sophie's upset, and Donna assumes that Sophie wants to cancel the wedding and offers to handle all the details. Sophie's offended and vows that her children won't grow up not knowing who their father is. As Sophie storms out of the room, Sam enters and tries to tell Donna that Sophie may not be all she seems, but Donna won't listen (""One of Us""). She hates Sam; at the end of their affair, she said she never wanted to see him again.  But it seems that Sam was the man Donna cared about the most, and both of them wish they could go back to the start (""SOS""').At the beach, Harry asks Tanya what the father of the bride ought to be doing for Sophie's wedding. Tanya explains that for her part, her father gave her his advice and then paid. Pepper, one of the guys who works at Donna's taverna, makes advances to Tanya, but she rebuffs him (""Does Your Mother Know"").Sky finds out what Sophie has done in inviting Sam, Harry and Bill to the wedding. He accuses her of wanting a big white wedding only so that she can find out who her father is. He's very hurt that she kept this plan a secret from him. He storms off just as Sam walks in. Sam tries to give Sophie some fatherly advice by describing his failed marriage (""Knowing Me, Knowing You""), but Sophie isn't consoled.Harry offers to Donna to pay for the wedding, and they reminisce about their fling (""Our Last Summer""). Sophie arrives and Donna helps her get dressed. She can't believe her daughter is going to be a bride (""Slipping Through My Fingers""). Donna admits that her own mother disowned her when she learned that she was pregnant. They reconcile and Sophie asks her mother if she will walk her down the aisle. Sam arrives and tries to speak to Donna again, but she doesn't want to see him, and asks him to leave. He refuses, and a bitter confrontation ensues. Donna tells Sam that he broke her heart, presumably when she found out he was engaged (""The Winner Takes It All""). It emerges that the two still love each other dearly, albeit against Donna's better judgment.Rosie is making final preparations in the taverna when Bill arrives. He's upset because he has received a note that Donna will be walking Sophie down the aisle. Bill reaffirms his commitment to the single life, but Rosie has become attracted to him, and urges him to reconsider (""Take a Chance on Me""). They are about to have sex in the taverna, but the guests arrive, leaving Rosie quite stunned.The wedding begins, with Donna walking Sophie down the aisle. Before the priest has a chance to begin the ceremonies, Donna acknowledges to everyone that Sophie's father is present. Sophie tells her mother that she knows about her father. Donna realizes that Sophie invited them to the wedding for that very reason. The issue of Sophie's parentage is left unsettled, as none of them have any idea whether they are actually her father. Everyone involved agrees that it doesn't matter which one of them her biological parent is, as Sophie loves all three and they are all happy to be ""one-third of a father"" and a part of her life at last. Finally, Harry, who has made frequent references to his ""other half"" throughout the show, is revealed to be in a committed gay relationship.Suddenly, Sophie calls a halt to the proceedings. She isn't ready to get married and Sky agrees with her about not getting married. Sam seizes his chance and proposes to Donna in order to prevent the wedding preparations from going to waste. He explains that he loved her, even when he left to get married. It is revealed that he called off the wedding and came back to the island, only to be told that Donna was going out with another man (Bill). He went back, married his fiancée and had children but he got divorced. Surprisingly, Donna accepts (""I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do, I Do""). In the end, Sam and Donna are married, and at the end of the night, Sophie and Sky depart on a round-the-world tour (""I Have a Dream""). Finale and encore After their final bows to the audience, the ensemble performs a reprise of ""Mamma Mia"". A reprise of ""Dancing Queen"" follows, during which Donna, Tanya, Rosie are revealed wearing brightly colored ABBA inspired costumes. The cast ends the finale with ""Waterloo"", during which Sam, Bill, and Harry join the rest of the cast onstage in brightly colored costumes that match the leading ladies. The Dynamos and the dads often invite the audience to clap, dance, and sing along during the finale.","Young Sophie is getting married soon. The main dream of 20-year-old girl is to be lead to the altar by her father. Donna brought up Sophie alone, so she does not know the man's name. Finding mother’s personal diary, which she has been writing for 9 months before the birth of a daughter, she found that a woman has had three romancing lines in that period. Sophie decided to invite Sam, Bill & Harry – lovers – at her wedding. She was hoping to find out during the celebration who is her father. Donna did not know anything about the daughter’s intentions. She invited to the wedding of Sophie her friends, with whom previously played in the same music band. The day before the celebration Tanya and Rosie arrived. One of them was rich, already divorced three times, and the other remained unmarried dasher. Women were very happy to see each other, and began to remember the tempestuous past.  Sam, Bill and Harry arrived soon. Donna was very surprised to see her former boyfriends. Sophie had time to ask the men not to tell her mother about the fact that she invited them to the wedding. So, Donna thought that her former lovers decided to come to the celebration at their own. She was very upset because of this, but friends managed to lift her spirit. Sophie thought that immediately would recognize her father as soon as she’ll see him. But unfortunately it did not happen. Shortly the bachelorette party of Sophie has been arranged. Rosie, Donna, and Tanya dressed up in old suits and performed inflaming concert in front of the guests. During a bachelorette party, Sophie tried to find out which of the men is her father. She talked to Sam, Harry and Bill consequentially. Only a third suspected that Sophie might be his daughter. Aunt of Bill left Donna a legacy, so that the woman was able to open her tavern. She asked the man to lead her to the altar, but he advised to discuss it first with Sophie. Suddenly, Donna did not want anyone to know about the fatherhood. Sophie asked Bill not to say anything to her mother. Yielding to the entreaties of the girl, he agreed. Soon, Sam and Harry came to the girl. Every one of them finally realized why she had invited them to the wedding, and promised to take her to the altar. The bride did not know what to do – she did not want to disappoint any of her possible fathers.  After the nightmare's dream of Sophie, Donna began to find out whether her child really wants to get married. But she rejected the doubts of mother. She wanted her children to know the name of own father, so wedding was to be held with Skye. Upset because of a quarrel with her daughter, Donna refused to talk to Sam, who came to talk to her. She still has not forgiven the man for his sudden departure many years ago. Soon Skye learned why Sophie has invited three of her mother's lovers. He accused the girl that she had decided to marry just to find out who her real father is. Sam tried to comfort Sophie, but it did not work. Donna helped her daughter to wear a wedding dress and could not believe that her girl is a grown-up now. She told Sophie about how she disowned her when found out about the pregnancy. Hearing this, the girl asked Donna to take her to the altar. Men were a little upset to hear about this choice of a bride.  When Donna lead Sophie the path to the altar, she told guests that the girl's father is present in the room. But the woman did not know which of the suitors gave life to her daughter – all dating have taken place in a very short period. The men agreed that fatherhood on a third is better than nothing – as long as they can continue to taking care of Sophie. Suddenly she interrupted the ceremony. She told Skye that is not yet ready for the wedding. The groom undertook this with understanding.  Taking advantage of this, Sam decided to make an offer to Donna. The man explained why he left his favorite – he had to cancel own engagement with fiancée that he had. Returning back, Sam learned that Donna has met Bill. As a result, he married his former fiancée. Now the man is divorced. When he learned that Sam still loves her, Donna agreed to become his wife. Wedding ceremony continued. Sophie decided to implement yet another dream, and went to Skye on a long trip abroad."
Cats,"  Act I – When Cats Are Maddened by the Midnight Dance After the overture, the cats gather on stage and describe the Jellicle tribe and its purpose (""Jellicle Songs for Jellicle Cats""). The cats (who break the fourth wall throughout the show) then notice that they are being watched by a human audience, and proceed to explain how the different cats of the tribe are named (""The Naming of Cats""). This is followed by a ballet solo performed by Victoria to signal the beginning of the Jellicle Ball (""The Invitation to the Jellicle Ball""). At this moment, Munkustrap, the show's main narrator, explains that tonight the Jellicle patriarch Old Deuteronomy will make an appearance and choose one of the cats to be reborn into a new life on the Heaviside Layer.The first contender Munkustrap introduces is Jennyanydots (""The Old Gumbie Cat""), a large tabby cat who lazes around all day, but come nighttime, she becomes active, teaching mice and cockroaches various activities to curb their naturally destructive habits. Just as Jennyanydots finishes her song, the music changes suddenly and Rum Tum Tugger makes his extravagant entrance in front of the tribe (""The Rum Tum Tugger""). He is very fickle and unappeasable, ""for he will do as he do do, and there's no doing anything about it"".Then, as Rum Tum Tugger's song fades, a shabby old grey cat stumbles out wanting to be reconciled; it is Grizabella. All the cats back away from her in fear and disgust and explain her unfortunate state (""Grizabella: The Glamour Cat""). Grizabella leaves and the music changes to a cheerful upbeat number as Bustopher Jones, a fat cat in ""a coat of fastidious black"", is brought to the stage (""Bustopher Jones: The Cat About Town""). Bustopher Jones is among the elite of the cats, and visits prestigious gentlemen's clubs. Suddenly, a loud crash startles the tribe and the cats run offstage in fright. Hushed giggling sounds signal the entrance of Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer, a pair of near-identical cats. They are mischievous petty burglars who enjoy causing trouble around their human neighbourhood (""Mungojerrie and Rumpleteazer""). After they finish, they are caught off-guard and confronted by the rest of the cats.Finally, the Jellicle patriarch, Old Deuteronomy, arrives before the tribe (""Old Deuteronomy""). He is a wise old cat who ""has lived many lives"" and is tasked with choosing which Jellicle will go to the Heaviside Layer every year. The cats put on a play for Old Deuteronomy (""The Awefull Battle of the Pekes and the Pollicles""), telling a story about two dog tribes clashing in the street and subsequently being scared away by the Great Rumpus Cat. A sombre moral from Old Deuteronomy is interrupted by a second loud crash, presumably from Macavity, which sends the alarmed cats scurrying. After a quick patrol for Macavity, Old Deuteronomy deems it a false alarm and summons the cats back as the main celebration begins (""The Jellicle Ball""), in which the cats sing and display their ""Terpsichorean powers"".During the Ball, Grizabella reappears and is once again shunned by the other cats (""Grizabella: The Glamour Cat (Reprise)"") while Old Deuteronomy looks on sadly. She tries to dance along, but her age and decrepit condition prevent her from doing so (""Memory (Prelude)""). Act II – Why Will the Summer Day Delay – When Will Time Flow Away? After the Jellicle Ball, Old Deuteronomy contemplates ""what happiness is"", referring to Grizabella. However, the cats do not understand him, so he has Jemima (also known as Sillabub), the youngest of all Jellicles, sing it in simpler terms (""The Moments of Happiness""). Gus – short for Asparagus – shuffles forward as the next cat to be introduced (""Gus: The Theatre Cat""). He was once a famous actor but is now old and ""suffers from palsy which makes his paws shake"". He is accompanied by Jellylorum, his caretaker, who tells of his exploits. Gus then remembers how he once played the infamous pirate captain, Growltiger a.k.a. the Terror of the Thames (""Growltiger's Last Stand""). Gus tells the story about the pirate captain's romance with Lady Griddlebone, and how Growltiger was overtaken by the Siamese and forced to walk the plank to his death.Back in the present, after Gus exits, Skimbleshanks is seen sleeping in the corner (""Skimbleshanks: The Railway Cat""). He is the cat who is unofficially in charge of the night train to Glasgow. Skimbleshanks is considered vital to the rail operations, as without him ""the train can't start"". Within his song, a whole steam train engine is assembled out of objects in the junkyard.With a third crash and an evil laugh, the ""most wanted"" cat Macavity appears. He is the so-called ""Napoleon of Crime"" who always manages to evade the authorities. Macavity's henchmen capture Old Deuteronomy and take off with the patriarch in tow. As Munkustrap and his troop give chase, Demeter and Bombalurina explain what they know about Macavity (""Macavity: The Mystery Cat""). When they are finished, Macavity returns disguised as Old Deuteronomy, but his cover is blown by Demeter and he ends up in a fight with Munkustrap and Alonzo. Macavity holds his own for a time, but as the rest of the tribe begin to gang up and surround him, he shorts out the stage lights and escapes in the resulting confusion.After the fight, Rum Tum Tugger calls upon the magician Mr. Mistoffelees for help (""Magical Mr. Mistoffelees""). Known as the ""original conjuring cat"", Mr. Mistoffelees can perform feats of magic that no other cat can do. He displays his magical powers in a dance solo and uses them to restore the lights and bring back Old Deuteronomy. Now, the Jellicle Choice can be made.Before Old Deuteronomy can announce his decision, Grizabella returns to the junkyard and he allows her to address the gathering. Her faded appearance and lonely disposition have little effect on her song (""Memory""). With acceptance and encouragement from Jemima and Victoria, her appeal succeeds and she is chosen to be the one to go to the Heaviside Layer and be reborn into a new Jellicle life (""The Journey to the Heaviside Layer""). A tyre rises from the piles of junk, carrying Grizabella and Old Deuteronomy partway toward the sky; Grizabella then completes the journey on her own. Finally, Old Deuteronomy gives an address to the audience, closing the show with (""The Ad-dressing of Cats"").Notes:","It happens 1 time per every year, when the cats horde named Jellicle gather in a common place and decide who will be the next ascender to the Heaviside Layer – some kind of a mystical place. Cats are presented to the audience in order audience to know with whom interaction goes in the musical – as an integral part of the play. From this, we learn about what cats are gathered here and about their distinctive features (for example, the song Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer or a cat with the funny name Jennyanydots, song The Old Gumbie Cat). Once after the cats ball, the audience learns that the Heaviside Layer is, possibly, some ritual place or both a place and a ritual that would allow one of the cats to reborn to a new life (without showing exactly how it would happen).  Alternately different cats come to the scene and every cat under own song presents himself, with the result that we learn about their character and position in the cat’s hierarchy, and how surrounding ones treat them. For example, there is a large and thick imposing cat, which goes to a club of local cats-gentlemen (or, rather, gentlecats?). Or an old she-cat, whom other cats try to avoid (in the past, she was the star of the theatre but now lost most of the charm). Or we know a couple of idlers, petty thieves and hooligans.  Then the main action begins, when it comes to cat named Old Deuteronomy, old and decrepit, who survived more than one or even more than a dozen of his wives, a mentor who has to choose someone who will follow him in the Heaviside Layer, a sacred place. All the cats begin to dance on the cat's ball, and decrepit old cat Grizabella was trying to dance with them too, but it didn’t work, and so instead she sings Memory – hit song, which greatly added to the popularity of this musical.  After this soulful performance, Grizabella is selected for rebirth and the ceremony of choosing ends with the official song of Old Deuteronomy. On the scene, we see cat Asparagus, which tells about the past own bygone days and as he was known star, but now he is old and decrepit and has palsy paws. Cat Skimbleshanks – mascot of the night train to Glasgow and all the cats are went to the local scrapyard to portray the train – someone turns the wheels made of the materials at hand, and someone shows other details.  Arriving local bully steals an Old Deuteronomy, disguised in his clothes and shows himself like this, but exposed and expelled. Old Deuteronomy returns to the place and the ceremony of ascension begins. Grizabella ascends to the sky on the large tire, sending her recognition to all and a speech until the curtain finals the show."
Guys and Dolls,"  Act I A pantomime of never-ceasing activities depicts the hustle and bustle of New York City (""Runyonland""). Three small-time gamblers, Nicely-Nicely Johnson, Benny Southstreet, and Rusty Charlie, argue over which horse will win a big race (""Fugue for Tinhorns""). The band members of the Save-a-Soul Mission, led by the pious and beautiful Sergeant Sarah Brown, call for sinners to ""Follow the Fold"" and repent. Nicely and Benny's employer, Nathan Detroit, runs an illegal floating crap game. Due to local policeman Lt. Brannigan's strong-armed presence, he has found only one likely spot to hold the game: the ""Biltmore garage."" Its owner, Joey Biltmore, requires a $1,000 security deposit, and Nathan is broke (""The Oldest Established""). Nathan hopes to win a $1,000 bet against Sky Masterson, a gambler willing to bet on virtually anything. Nathan proposes a bet he believes he cannot lose: Sky must take a woman of Nathan's choice to dinner in Havana, Cuba. Sky agrees, and Nathan chooses Sarah Brown. At the mission, Sky claims he wants to be saved, impressing Sarah with his knowledge of the Bible. He offers Sarah a deal: He will bring the mission ""one dozen genuine sinners"" if she will accompany him to Havana the next night. Sarah rebuffs him, telling him that she plans to fall in love with an upright, moral man. Sky replies that he plans on being surprised when he falls in love (""I'll Know""). Sky kisses Sarah, and she slaps him. Nathan goes to watch his fiancée of 14 years, Adelaide, perform her nightclub act (""A Bushel and a Peck""). After her show, she asks him, as she has many times before, to go down to city hall and get a marriage license. She also tells Nathan that she has been sending her mother letters for twelve years claiming that they have been married with five children. She is distraught to find out that Nathan is still running the crap game. She consults a medical book, which tells her that her chronic cold is a psychosomatic reaction to her frustration with Nathan's failure to marry her (""Adelaide's Lament"").The next day, Nicely and Benny watch as Sky pursues Sarah, and Nathan tries to win back Adelaide's favor. They declare that guys will do anything for the dolls they love (""Guys and Dolls""). General Cartwright, the leader of Save-a-Soul, visits the mission and explains that she will be forced to close the branch unless they succeed in bringing some sinners to the upcoming revival meeting. Sarah, desperate to save the mission, promises the General ""one dozen genuine sinners"", implicitly accepting Sky's deal. The gamblers, including a notorious gangster from Chicago named Big Jule, are waiting for Nathan to secure the spot for the game, and Lt. Brannigan becomes suspicious. To convince him of their innocence, they tell Brannigan their gathering is Nathan's ""surprise bachelor party"". This satisfies Brannigan, and Nathan resigns himself to eloping with Adelaide. Adelaide goes home to pack, promising to meet him after her show the next afternoon. The Save-A-Soul Mission band passes by, and Nathan sees that Sarah is not in it; he realizes that he lost the bet and faints.In a Havana nightclub, Sky buys a drink for himself and a ""Cuban milkshake"" for Sarah. She doesn't realize that the drink contains Bacardi rum, and innocently drinks multiple glasses, becoming progressively tipsier. Outside the club, Sarah kisses Sky and proclaims that she is truly enjoying herself for the first time in her life (""If I Were a Bell""). She wants to stay in Havana with Sky. Sky is surprised to find, though, that he truly cares about Sarah's welfare, and he insists that they go back to the airport and return to New York. Back in New York, it is 4:00 a.m., and as Sky and Sarah (now sober) stand in the street outside the mission, Sky tells her that this is his favorite time of day, and that she is the only woman he's ever wanted to share it with (""My Time of Day""). They both spontaneously admit that they're in love (""I've Never Been in Love Before""). A siren sounds and gamblers run out of the mission, where Nathan has been holding the crap game. Sarah infers that Sky took her to Havana and pretended to be in love with her just so Nathan could use the mission for the game, rejecting his protests of innocence. Act II The next evening, Adelaide performs her act at the Hot Box (""Take Back Your Mink""). Nathan doesn't show up for the elopement because he's still running the crap game. She soon realizes that Nathan has stood her up again and turns to her book for comfort (""Adelaide's Second Lament"").Sarah admits to Arvide, her grandfather and fellow mission worker, that she loves Sky but will never see him again because she believes he is responsible for the previous night's crap game. Arvide expresses his faith in Sky's inherent goodness and urges Sarah to follow her heart (""More I Cannot Wish You""). Sky tells Sarah he intends to deliver the dozen genuine sinners for the revival. She doesn't believe him and walks off, but Arvide subtly encourages him.Nicely shows Sky where the game is being held: the sewer (""Crapshooters Dance""). Big Jule has lost a large amount of cash and insists on playing on credit. To change his luck he uses his own dice, which are blank, and proceeds to cheat Nathan out of all of his money. Sky then arrives with Nicely. Big Jule isn't impressed, but Sky responds by punching him out. He then gives Nathan $1,000, saying that Nathan won the bet and implying that Sarah refused to go to Havana with him. Sky, determined to get the dozen sinners he promised Sarah, bets everyone at the game a thousand dollars against their souls. If he loses, every man gets a thousand dollars; if he wins, they must all attend the revival at the mission (""Luck Be a Lady""). He tosses the dice. The gamblers head towards the mission, and it is clear that Sky has won his bet. On his way there, Nathan runs into Adelaide and tells her that he has to attend the prayer meeting. Adelaide does not believe him. She asks herself why she keeps putting up with Nathan's lies, and he tells her that he loves her (""Sue Me"").Sky and the gamblers arrive at the mission, much to Sarah's surprise. General Cartwright asks if anyone wishes to testify to their sins. Benny and Big Jule do, but another gambler named Harry The Horse lets slip that Sky only got them to the meeting because he won their souls in a dice game. The General is very pleased by this as it shows that good can come out of evil. Attempting to appear contrite, Nicely invents a dream that encouraged him to repent, and the gamblers join in with revivalist fervor (""Sit Down, You're Rockin' the Boat""). Brannigan arrives and threatens to arrest everyone for the crap game in the Mission, but Sarah clears them, saying that none of the gamblers were at the mission the previous night. After Brannigan leaves, Nathan confesses that they held the crap game in the mission. He also confesses to the bet he made with Sky about taking Sarah to Havana. He adds that he won the bet, to Sarah's shock, and she realizes that Sky wanted to protect her reputation and must genuinely care about her.Sarah and Adelaide run into each other, and they commiserate and then resolve to marry their men anyway and reform them later (""Marry the Man Today""). Several weeks later, Nathan has opened a newsstand. Sky and Sarah have just been married, and Sky is playing the drum in the mission band. Adelaide and Nathan are about to get married at the mission, and Sky tells Nathan he'll lay eight to ten odds that he will be very happy. Adelaide expresses joy at the thought of being together with Nathan forever. Nathan sneezes in response, implying that he has developed a cold similar to Adelaide. The title song is reprised (""Guys and Dolls"" (Finale/Reprise)).","Nathan Detroit is a hardened gambler. He is an expert in his own field and arranges the big games for the big people. His only difficulty at this time is the need to find somewhere the $1,000 and to get away from under dangerous sight of Lieutenant Brannigan.  The question is about the place of the game’s conduction, because in the whole New York City there is only one safe corner left – garage in Baltimore, however, a large deposit was requested for it. Detroit should look for that kind of money in a short time, and he finds a way out, when he suddenly hits a man known in that he can make a bet on anything – Sky Masterson. By negligence, Sky offers Detroit a deal just for that necessary amount, betting that he can take with him to Havana the next day any woman that he only wants to, but Nathan takes this opportunity to call him, earnestly believing that Sarah Brown, leader of the organization ""rescue mission shower"", will not go for that.  Detroit is absolutely sure that the righteous Sarah would not agree to go to Cuba with a man like Sky. Sly Masterson makes a deal with the girl, promising her a dozen of sinners, if she will have dinner with him. Fortunate circumstances convince Sarah to the necessity of this step, and Sky goes with her to Havana.  Of course, it could not happen so that an elegant love line would not opened. For one evening with each other, both realize that their feelings are anxiously huddle on edge, but the next morning, when early they returned to New York, Sarah learns that Sky made a bet on her and that, in her opinion, he is responsible for holding a big game. A man cannot convince her otherwise, but he still remembers his promise about a dozen sinners, and although Sarah does not believe him, he is convinced that he must do for her everything he can.  So Masterson is sent to Nathan, to give him 1000, falsifying his loss, and after bets on the game, to conclude deals with all gamblers on their souls if he wins, against $ 1,000 in case of his loss. After the game, won by Masterson, all participants go to the ""Mission"", at a huge surprise of Sarah, who admits that she should believe in Mr. Sky.  Mr. Detroid eventually, quite sincerely repents, apologizes to his bride that he could not take as a wife for 14 years, and forgets gambling, becoming a decent person. This is all done for the sake of dollies, which they love, after which the name to this show was given."
Pippin,"  Act 1 This musical begins with the Leading Player of a troupe and the accompanying actors in various costume pieces from several different time periods, establishing the play's intentionally anachronistic, defamiliarized, unconventional feel. The Leading Player and troupe, throughout the performance, metafictionally channel the Brechtian distancing effect and immediately break the fourth wall, directly speaking to the audience and provocatively inviting their attention (""Magic to Do""). They begin a story about a boy prince searching for existential fulfillment. They reveal that the boy who is to play the prince, named Pippin, is a new actor. Pippin talks to scholars of his dreams to find where he belongs (""Corner of the Sky""), and they happily applaud Pippin on his ambitious quest for an extraordinary life. Pippin then returns home to the castle and estate of his father, King Charles (known by the epithet ""Charlemagne""). Charles and Pippin don't get a chance to communicate often, as they are interrupted by nobles, soldiers, and courtiers vying for Charles' attention (""Welcome Home""), and Charles is clearly uncomfortable speaking with his educated son or expressing any loving emotions. Pippin also meets up with his stepmother Fastrada, and her dim-witted son Lewis. Charles and Lewis are planning on going into battle against the Visigoths soon, and Pippin begs Charles to take him along so as to prove himself. Charles reluctantly agrees and proceeds to explain a battle plan to his men (""War is a Science"").Once in battle, the Leading Player re-enters to lead the troupe in a mock battle using top hats, canes, and fancy jazz to glorify warfare and violence (""Glory""), with the Leading Player and two lead dancers in the middle (performing Bob Fosse's famous ""Manson Trio""). This charade of war does not appeal to Pippin, and he flees into the countryside. The Leading Player tells the audience of Pippin's travels through the country, until he stops at his exiled grandmother's estate (""Simple Joys""). There, Berthe (his paternal grandmother, exiled by Fastrada) tells Pippin not to be so serious and to live a little (""No Time At All""). Pippin takes this advice and decides to search for something a bit more lighthearted (""With You""). While he initially enjoys many meaningless sexual encounters, he soon discovers that relationships without love leave you ""empty and unfulfilled.""The Leading Player then tells Pippin that perhaps he should fight tyranny, and uses Charles as a perfect example of an uneducated tyrant to fight. Pippin plans a revolution, and Fastrada is delighted to hear that perhaps Charles and Pippin will both perish so that her beloved Lewis can become king. Fastrada arranges the murder of Charles, and Pippin falls victim to her plot (""Spread a Little Sunshine""). While Charles is praying at Arles, Pippin murders him, and becomes the new king (""Morning Glow""). The Leading Player mentions to the audience that they will break for now, but to expect a thoroughly thrilling finale. Act 2 Act 2 begins with Pippin trying his best to grant the wishes of as many people as possible. But he realizes that it is impossible to keep everyone happy. Pippin realizes that neither he nor his father could change society and seemed forced to act as tyrants. He begs the Leading Player to bring his slain father back to life, and the Leading Player does so as Charlemagne nonchalantly comes back to life and mildly scolds Pippin. He feels directionless until the Leading Player inspires him (""On the Right Track""). After experimenting with art and religion, he falls into monumental despair and collapses on the floor.Widowed farm-owner Catherine finds him on the street, and is attracted by the arch of his foot (""And There He Was"") and when Pippin comes to, she introduces herself to Pippin (""Kind of Woman""). From the start, it is clear that the Leading Player is concerned with Catherine's acting ability and actual attraction to Pippin — after all, she is but a player playing a part in the Leading Player's yet-to-be-unfolded plan. At first, Pippin thinks himself above such boring manorial duties as sweeping, repairs, and milking cows (""Extraordinary""), but eventually he comforts Catherine's small boy, Theo, on the sickness and eventual death of his pet duck (“Prayer for a Duck"") and warms up to the lovely Catherine (""Love Song""). However, as time goes by, Pippin feels that he must leave the estate to continue searching for his purpose. Catherine is heartbroken and reflects on him, much to the Leading Player's anger and surprise (""I Guess I'll Miss the Man"").All alone on a stage, Pippin is surrounded by the Leading Player and the various troupe members. They all suggest that Pippin complete the most perfect act ever: the Finale. They tell Pippin to jump into a box of fire, light himself up, and ""become one with the flame."" Pippin is reluctant at first, but slowly loses resistance (""Finale""). He is stopped by his natural misgivings and also by one actress from the troupe—the woman playing Catherine. Catherine and her son Theo stand by Pippin and defy the script, the Leading Player, and the Troupe. Pippin comes to the realization that the widow's home was the only place where he was truly happy (""Magic Shows and Miracles""). Having experimented with every possible path to fulfillment, he feels humbled, and realizes that maybe the most fulfilling road of all is a modest, ordinary life. He comes to the conclusion that, while ""settling down"" may at times be mundane and boring, ""if [he's] never tied to anything, [he'll] never be free."" The Leading Player becomes furious and calls off the show, telling the rest of the troupe and even the orchestra to pack up and leave Pippin, Catherine, and her son alone on an empty, dark and silent stage, yelling at Pippin, ""You try singing without music, sweetheart!"" Pippin realizes that he has given up his extraordinary purpose for the simplest and most ordinary life of all, and he is finally a happy man. When Catherine asks him how he feels, he says he feels ""trapped, but happy, which isn't bad for the end of a musical comedy. Tada!"" Extended ending Some newer productions of Pippin, including the 2013 Broadway revival, have featured an extension to the original ending. The ""Theo ending"" was originally conceived in 1998 by Mitch Sebastian. After the troupe shuns Pippin for not performing the grand finale, and he avers his contentment with a simple life with Catherine, Theo remains alone onstage, and sings a verse of ""Corner of the Sky,"" after which the Leading Player and the troupe return, backed by the ""Magic to Do"" melody, implying that the existential crisis at the heart of the play is part of a cycle and will now continue, but with Theo as the troupe's replacement for Pippin. Current productions vary between the two possible endings, though Schwartz himself has expressed his preference for the newer ending.","Narrator, accompanied by actors, dressed in attires of various historical periods, announces the present public that starting histrionics promises to be humorous, full of ups & downs, with a stunning finale. A youthful heir of the throne named Pippin, filled with higher meaning. A young man was searching own way in life so he conducted conversations with the scientists who inspired him to find his destiny. Later, he went to his father's castle, belonging to King Charles. However, father & son could not talk normally, as they were disturbed all the time by intrusive people striving for the attention of their ruler. The latter one also felt uncomfortable from communication with own son, who was over-educated for king’s brains. Heir of the throne has a stepmother, who has a narrow-minded son-warrior. The upcoming war with Visigoths was scheduled & the young man thought that this was his real chance to find oneself on the battlefield. After all, such military affairs might suit him.  However, the young prince soon realizes that the war is not only the glory & the victory, but it is blood, violence & death. That’s why he ran from the battlefield & hided in the village. The audience’s attention once again takes narrator, telling about the wandering of prince, until he finally found refuge in the estate of his grandmother. Despite the fact that the grandmother has long been dwelling as an outcast, she has not lost her vitality. An old woman advises her grandson to enjoy life & to be a little careless. Using such an advice, the young man starts several frivolous romance novels. However, the realization that the relationship without deep love is empty, forces the young man to give up the idea to conduct such a carefree life.  Narrator advises the prince to begin to fight against tyranny, in particular, the brutal tyranny in the kingdom of his father. But in the kingdom, another evil is afoot: the queen is planning the murder of her husband & stepson & secretly hopes that her lover will become a king. However, its undertaking hasn’t come true, because Pippin kills his father & ascends to the throne.  The new king is desperately trying to please all the people who came to ask for his help & intercession. But soon the young king realizes that it is impossible to bring happiness to everyone, that this problem is beyond the power of either his father or himself. In any case, for someone ruler will remain a tyrant. The young king asks narrator to turn his father back to life, recognizing own mistakes & recklessness. King, after coming back to life, gently reproves the son for what he did & the young man again feels overwhelmed. But narrator inspires him to turn to art & religion. Suddenly, may it be a path that he should follow? However, as with military affair, the young man was disappointed with these ones.  In search of a new goal, the young prince wandered into a small village, where he met a young woman. He was watching at the everyday hard work of the peasants & understood that milking cows & sweeping the yard was not his vocation. Settling there for a short while, he eventually leaves the village, breaking the heart of his mistress.  After returning to his home, the young man finally realized that a modest peasant house was the only place where he was truly happy. Looking at his experience, recalling his desperate attempts to find true purpose, suddenly it comes clear for him that only a simple life without luxuries may be of a full capacity."
Anything Goes," Four versions of the libretto of Anything Goes exist: the original 1934 libretto, the 1962 off-Broadway revival libretto, the 1987 revival libretto, and the 2011 revival libretto. The story has been revised, though all involve similar romantic complications aboard the SS American and feature the same major characters. The score has been altered, with some songs cut and others reassigned to different scenes and characters, and augmented with various Porter songs from other shows. Act I Billy Crocker, a young Wall Street broker, has fallen in love with a beautiful girl he met at a party and spends the evening with in a taxi. His boss, Elisha J. Whitney, is preparing to make a business deal and is going to travel to London aboard the SS American. Evangelist turned nightclub singer Reno Sweeney will be traveling aboard the same ship. Billy sees Reno as a friend, but she obviously has feelings for him (""I Get A Kick Out of You""). Billy goes to the dock to say farewell to his boss and Reno (""Bon Voyage""), and glimpses the mysterious girl again. He learns that she is heiress Hope Harcourt and, escorted by her mother, Mrs. Harcourt, is on her way to England with her fiancé Lord Evelyn Oakleigh, a handsome but stuffy and hapless British nobleman. Billy stows away on the ship in hopes of winning Hope's heart. ""Moonface"" Martin, a second-rate gangster labeled ""Public Enemy 13,"" and his girlfriend, Bonnie, have disguised themselves as a minister and a missionary and, innocently aided by Billy, board the ship under their assumed identities, stranding the ship's real chaplain back at the port. Moonface and Bonnie mistakenly leave behind their leader, ""Snake Eyes"" Johnson, Public Enemy 1.To thank Billy, Bonnie and Moonface let him have Snake Eyes Johnson's passport and ticket without telling him to whom they belong. Billy cons Evelyn into leaving him alone with Hope, by convincing him he is very ill. When he goes to get some air, Billy and Hope meet again, and it turns out she has been unable to stop thinking about him as well (""All Through The Night""). Though Hope prefers Billy, she insists she must marry Evelyn, though she gives no reason. Unbeknownst to Billy, her family's company is in financial trouble and a marriage to Evelyn would promote a merger and save it. The ship's crew gets a cable from New York saying that Public Enemy 1 is on board. Moonface admits his true identity to Billy and he and Bonnie conspire to disguise Billy as a crew member since he is now presumed to be Snake Eyes Johnson.A quartet of lovelorn sailors comfort themselves with the thought of romance when they reach shore (""There'll Always Be a Lady Fair""). On deck, Bonnie lures the sailors to her (""Where Are The Men?""), then steals the clothes of one of the men for Billy.Hope discusses her impending marriage with Evelyn and discovers that he is not particularly pleased with the engagement either. Billy asks Reno to help separate Evelyn and Hope, and she agrees. Billy and Reno reaffirm their friendship, (""You're the Top""). Reno tries to charm Evelyn, she succeeds, and he invites her for a drink in his cabin. She and Moon plot that Moon should burst into the cabin and discover Reno half-naked in Evelyn's arms, providing sufficient reason for breaking off the engagement. However, when Moon breaks into the room, machine gun in tow, he instead sees Reno fully dressed and Evelyn nearly undressed. Moon tries to invent some indecent explanation for the situation, but Evelyn insists that he would be quite pleased by any rumor depicting him as a passionate lover, especially if Hope heard it. Moon admits that the plot has failed.The crew discover that Billy is not a sailor, and Moon and Reno create a new disguise for him from a stolen pair of trousers, a jacket taken from a drunken passenger, and hair cut from Mrs. Harcourt's Pomeranian and made into a beard. Reno tells Billy that Evelyn has kissed her, and she is sure she will be Lady Oakleigh soon, since love moves so quickly these days (""Anything Goes""). Mrs. Harcourt, recognizing her dog's hair, angrily pulls off Billy's beard and the crew and passengers realize he must be the wanted man. As Snake Eyes Johnson, Billy is an instant celebrity. Act II Billy is honored by both crew and passengers as ""Public Enemy Number One."" He tells the Captain that Moon (who is still disguised as a minister) is helping him reform from his wicked ways. Moon is asked to lead a revival in the ship's lounge. The passengers confess their sins to the ""Reverend,"" and Lord Evelyn admits to a one-night stand with a young Chinese woman, Plum Blossom. Hope is not impressed with Billy's charade, and to please her, he confesses to everyone that he is not really Snake Eyes Johnson. Moon attempts to compensate by revealing that he is not a minister; he is Public Enemy Number Thirteen. The captain sends them both to the brig. Reno restores the mood of the Revival (""Blow, Gabriel Blow"").Moon tries to cheer Billy up (""Be Like the Bluebird""). Billy doubts he will ever see Hope again; he and Moon cannot leave their cell until they return to America. Their card-playing Chinese cellmates, imprisoned for conning all the third class passengers out of their money, will be put ashore in England. Moon and Billy challenge them to a game of strip poker, win their clothes, and disguise themselves again.Billy, Moon, and Reno show up at the Oakleigh estate in Chinese garb. Billy and Moon tell Oakleigh's uncle that they are the parents of ""Plum Blossom"" and threaten to publicize Evelyn's indiscretion if he does not marry her. Oakleigh offers to buy them off and Moon gleefully accepts the cash, much to Billy and Reno's chagrin.Billy and Reno find Hope and Evelyn, who are both unhappy with the prospect of their matrimony. Hope declares that she desperately wants to marry Billy (""The Gypsy in Me""). Billy spots Whitney and finally learns that Evelyn and Hope's planned marriage is really an awkward business merger. Billy realises that Oakleigh is manipulating them all; Hope's company is really worth millions and Billy informs Whitney of that fact. Whitney offers to buy the firm from Hope at an exorbitant price, and she accepts. The marriage is called off since a merger is now impossible. Billy and Hope get married, as do Reno and Evelyn. A cable from the U.S. government fixes Billy's passport problems and declares Moon ""harmless."" Moon indignantly pockets Oakleigh's check and refuses to return it.","Act 1  SS American is a ship that sails from the USA to Europe, England. There is a fairly bright and motley crowd on board, each with their own vision of life. There are: a broker who become a bankrupt (""broke broker"", as he says about himself); heiress and her zooty dude satellite, that assesses all dapperly, on the basis of own appearance; a mother of a wealthy heiress who looks more subtle and refined than her daughter; former preacher of the church, who left it to earn and now is a patron of dance pip show; and the company of very beautiful girls who are very sinners, seekers and finders of adventures on the fifth point.  The news that rich unmarried woman floats onboard who is going to receive an offer (for the money), is haunted Billy, who is broker here and he's going to own this tidbit, not to share such potential wealth with anyone (and gather himself, but eventually falls in live truly).

After he has been discovered, he was arrested and put in prison on the ship, where he talks through singing about his feelings. To get out of prison, Billy plays strip poker with Chinese on board and now he is dressed like them, so by the end of the play he runs away, taking with him his partner during the wedding ceremony, which was acting on the board closer to arrival to Europe."
Kinky Boots,"  Act I Charlie Price grows up as the fourth-generation ""son"" in his family business, Price & Son, a shoe manufacturing company with its factory in Northampton. Another young boy, growing up in London, is as fascinated by shoes as Charlie is bored by them. But in this case, it is a pair of red women's heels that have attracted his attention, aggravating his strict father. Years pass. Charlie's father is aging and hopes that Charlie will take over the factory, but Charlie is eager to move to London with his status-conscious fiancée, Nicola, and pursue a career in real estate (""The Most Beautiful Thing"").Charlie has barely made it into his new flat in London when his father dies suddenly. Charlie hurries home for the funeral, where he finds the factory near bankruptcy. The factory makes good quality men's shoes, but they are not stylish and not cheap, and the market for them is drying up. Charlie is determined to save the factory and his father's legacy, though he has no desire to run Price & Sons himself. The workers, many of whom have known Charlie his entire life, do not understand why Charlie had moved away in the first place, and many are hostile and skeptical of the new management.Returning to London, Charlie meets his friend and fellow shoe salesman, Harry, in a pub to ask for help with the factory. Harry can only offer a temporary solution and advises Charlie not to fight the inevitable (""Take What You Got""). Leaving the pub, Charlie witnesses a woman being accosted by two drunks. He intervenes and is knocked unconscious. He comes to in a seedy nightclub, where the woman he attempted to rescue is revealed to have been the club's drag queen headliner, Lola, who performs with her backup troupe of drag dancers, the ""angels"" (""Land of Lola""). Recuperating from his ordeal in Lola's dressing room, an uncomfortable Charlie notices that the performers' high-heeled boots are not designed to hold a man's weight, but Lola explains that the expensive and unreliable footwear is an essential part of any drag act.Charlie returns to the factory and begins reluctantly laying off his workers. Lauren, one of the women on the assembly line, explodes at Charlie when given her notice, and stubbornly tells him that other struggling shoe factories have survived by entering an ""underserved niche market"". This gives Charlie an idea (""Land of Lola"" reprise), and he invites Lola to come to the factory to help him design a women's boot that can be comfortable for a man (""Charlie's Soliloquy""/""Step One"").Lola and the angels arrive at the factory, and she is immediately unsatisfied with Charlie's first design of the boot. Quickly getting the women of the factory on her side, she draws a quick design of a boot, explaining the most important factor is by far the heel (""The Sex is in the Heel"").  George, the factory manager, realizes a way to make her design practical, and an impressed Charlie begs Lola to stay until a prestigious footwear show in Milan in three weeks' time, to design a new line of ""kinky boots"" that could save the factory. Lola is reluctant, since she is already receiving crass comments from Don, the factory foreman and some of the other factory workers but is flattered by Charlie's praise, and finally agrees.Charlie announces that the factory will be moving ahead with production on the boots. He thanks Lauren for giving him the idea and offers her a promotion. She accepts and is horrified but thrilled to realize she is falling for him (""The History of Wrong Guys"").The next day, Lola shows up in men's clothes and is mocked by Don and his friends. An upset Lola takes refuge in the bathroom, and Charlie attempts to comfort her. Lola explains that her father trained her as a boxer, but disowned her when she showed up for a match in drag. The two discover their similarly complex feelings toward their fathers, and Lola introduces herself by her birth name: Simon (""Not My Father's Son"").Nicola and her boss Richard Bailey arrive from the city of London and present Charlie with a plan for the factory that Richard has drawn up: closing it and converting it into condominiums. Charlie refuses but is shocked to discover that his father had agreed to this plan before he died, presumably because Charlie was not there to run it. He refuses to sell, and soon the workers are celebrating as the first pair of ""kinky boots"" is finished (""Everybody Say Yeah""). Act II Some of the factory workers are not enthusiastic about the radical change in their product line.  Some of them, especially the intimidating Don, make Lola feel very unwelcome. Lola taunts him back, enlisting the help of the female factory workers to prove that Lola is closer to a woman's ideal man than Don (""What a Woman Wants""). Lola presents Don with a unique wager to see who is the better ""man"": Lola will do anything that Don specifies if Don will do the same thing for her. Don's challenge is for Lola to fight him in a boxing match at the pub. Charlie, remembering Lola's background, is horrified. Lola easily scores against Don in the ring but ultimately lets Don win the match (""In This Corner""). Afterward, in private, Don asks why she let him win, and Lola replies that she could not be so cruel as to humiliate Don in front of his mates. She gives him her part of the challenge: ""accept someone for who they are.""Charlie is pouring his own money into the factory to ensure it will be ready in time for Milan, and he is getting frantic that the product is not right, angrily forcing his staff to redo what he considers to be shoddy work. Nicola arrives, fed up with Charlie's obsession over the factory, and breaks up with him. Lola has been making some decisions about production and preparations without consulting Charlie. When he discovers that she has decided to have her angels wear the boots on the runway rather than hiring professional models, an overwhelmed Charlie lashes out at her, He humiliates her in front of the other workers. Lola storms out, and the factory workers go home. Alone, Charlie struggles with the weight of his father's legacy and what it means to be his own man (""Soul of a Man"").Lauren finds Charlie and tells him to come back to the factory. It is revealed that Don has persuaded all the workers to return to work and to sacrifice a week's pay to ensure the boots can be finished in time for Milan. Charlie is astonished and grateful and asks if Don has paid up on his wager by accepting Lola. Lauren explains that the person that Don has accepted is Charlie himself.As he heads to the airport for Milan, Charlie leaves a heartfelt apology on Lola's voicemail.  Meanwhile, Lola performs her act at a nursing home in her home town. After she leaves the stage, she speaks to her now wheelchair-bound father, who is dying in the home, and reaches a sense of closure (""Hold Me in Your Heart"").Charlie and Lauren arrive in Milan.

One very responsible step could change the whole life. But few have ever faced with such unusual problems as Charlie Price, a regular guy who dreams of living in London. He has a girlfriend, he makes a career in real estate. In his home comes the news that he has become the heir of going-bust shoe company of his father in a small town called Northampton.  The former owner of the company is his own father, a strict man of conservative looks. At the factory for decades, classic British men's shoes were produced, neither original in the style nor anything else, but they were practical with all the ensuing consequences. During the modern fashion’s development, company had a lot of problems, as fans of old classics became smaller and smaller in number, and therefore the shoe factory slowly but surely went to the bottom, out of which followed many fires. People remained without work, and it was hard to Charlie to accept it.  There remained only two options: to come up with something that can be done with the company, or to sell it and use the money to buy an apartment in London, how the girl of protagonist insisted. Man was standing in front of a difficult choice. One evening, after a series of hard dismissals, Charlie appeared at the bar, drinking to mute conscience and trying to make an important decision. He was thinking in the favor of sale of the family business but he met Lola.  Lola is a strong black transvestite, whose earlier name was Simon. Heavyweight boxer in the past, Lola also was a cabaret star, singer and dancer, working in gay clubs. Lola tells Charlie that she and her friends need strong and good shoes for performances, and shoes that can withstand the weight of the hundreds of kilograms are not often found on the shelves of the stores. And Charlie comes up with the brilliant idea, as he thought. He's going to change the orientation of the factory and create sturdy shoes for transvestites and transsexuals, and Lola becomes his assistant. They work hard, create the design and manufacture the production together. It decided to exhibit the created collection at a fashion show in Milan.  Hard work and a lot of tests get in the way of Charlie, who in the course of his decision and work loses his girlfriend, a lot of friends, respect of colleagues, who do not understand what they are doing, and even quarrels with Lola. But Charlie is going to the end. Even when he is almost completely alone on the show in Milan, the guy comes out on stage and demonstrates his own shoes, almost failing the show, but Lola and her friends suddenly appeared on the podium and saved the situation."
Miss Saigon,"  Act 1 In April 1975 at ""Dreamland,"" a Saigon bar and brothel, shortly before the end of the Vietnam War, it is Kim's first day as a bargirl. The seventeen-year-old peasant girl is hauled in by the Engineer, a French-Vietnamese hustler who owns the joint. Backstage, the girls ready themselves for the night's show, jeering at Kim's inexperience (""Overture / Backstage Dreamland""). The U.S. Marines, aware that they will be leaving Vietnam soon, party with the Vietnamese sex workers (""The Heat Is on in Saigon""). Chris Scott, a sergeant disenchanted by the club scene, is encouraged by his friend John Thomas to go with a girl. The girls compete for the title of ""Miss Saigon,"" and the winner is raffled to a Marine. Kim's guilelessness strikes Chris. Gigi Van Tranh wins the crown for the evening and begs the marine who won the raffle to take her back to America, annoying him. The showgirls reflect on their dreams of a better life (""Movie in My Mind""). John buys a room for Chris and the virgin Kim (""The Transaction""). Kim is reluctant and shy, but dances with Chris.  Chris tries to pay her to leave the nightclub. When the Engineer interferes, thinking that Chris does not like Kim, Chris allows himself to be led to her room (""The Dance"").Chris, watching Kim sleep, asks God why he met her just as he was about to leave Vietnam (""Why, God, Why?""). When Kim wakes up, Chris tries to give her money, but she refuses, saying that it is her first time sleeping with a man (""This Money's Yours""). Touched to learn that Kim is an orphan, Chris offers to take her to America with him. The two fall in love (""Sun and Moon""). Chris tells John that he is taking leave to spend time with Kim. John warns him that the Viet Cong will soon take Saigon, but then reluctantly agrees to cover for Chris (""The Telephone Song""). Chris meets with the Engineer to trade for Kim, but the Engineer tries to include an American visa in the deal. Chris forces the Engineer at gunpoint to honour the original arrangement for Kim (""The Deal"").The bargirls hold a ""wedding ceremony"" for Chris and Kim (""Dju Vui Vai""), with Gigi toasting Kim as the ""real"" Miss Saigon. Thuy, Kim's cousin, to whom she was betrothed at thirteen, arrives to take her home. He has since become an officer in the North Vietnamese Army and is disgusted to find her with a white man (""Thuy's Arrival""). The two men confront each other, drawing their guns. Kim tells Thuy that their arranged marriage is now nullified because her parents are dead, and she no longer harbours any feelings for him because of his betrayal. Thuy curses them all and storms out (""What's This I Find""). Chris promises to take Kim with him when he leaves Vietnam. Chris and Kim dance to the same song as on their first night (""Last Night of The World"").The scene then cuts to three years later, in 1978. A street parade is taking place in Saigon (since renamed Ho Chi Minh City) to celebrate the third anniversary of the reunification of Vietnam and the defeat of the Americans (""Morning of The Dragon""). Thuy, a commissar in the new Communist government, has ordered his soldiers to look for the still-corrupt Engineer. Thuy orders the Engineer to find Kim and bring her to him. Although the intervening period is not shown, it is apparent that Kim and Chris have become separated in the intervening three years. Kim has been hiding in an impoverished area, still in love with Chris and steadfastly believing that Chris will return to Vietnam and rescue her. Meanwhile, Chris is in bed with his new American wife, Ellen, when he wakes from a dream shouting Kim's name. Ellen and Kim both swear their devotion to Chris from opposite ends of the world (""I Still Believe"").A week later, Thuy's soldiers find the Engineer somewhere up north. For the Communist Party, he goes by the name ""Tran Van Dinh"" and has spent the past three years working in the rice fields. The Engineer takes Thuy to where Kim has been hiding. Kim refuses Thuy's renewed offer of marriage, unaware that his men are waiting outside the door. Furious, Thuy calls them in and they begin tying up Kim and the Engineer, threatening to put them into a re-education camp. Kim introduces him to Tam, her three-year-old son from Chris. Thuy calls Kim a traitor and Tam an enemy, and tries to kill Tam with a knife, but Kim pulls out a gun and kills Thuy (""You Will Not Touch Him""). She flees with Tam (""This Is the Hour"") and tells the Engineer what she has done (""If You Want to Die in Bed""). The Engineer refuses to help her until he learns that Tam's father is American (""Let Me See His Western Nose"") – thinking the boy is his chance to emigrate to the United States. He tells Kim that now he is the boy's uncle, and he will lead them to Bangkok. The three set out on a ship with other refugees (""I'd Give My Life for You""). Act 2 In Atlanta, Georgia, John now works for an aid organization whose mission is to connect Bui-Doi (from Vietnamese trẻ bụi đời ""street children,"" meaning children conceived during the war) with their American fathers (""Bui Doi""). John tells Chris that Kim is still alive, which Chris is relieved to hear after years of having nightmares of her dying.  He also tells Chris about Tam and urges Chris to go to Bangkok with Ellen. Chris finally tells Ellen about Kim and Tam (""The Revelation""). In Bangkok, the Engineer is hawking a sleazy club where Kim works as a dancer (""What A Waste""). Chris, Ellen, and John arrive in search of Kim. John finds Kim dancing at the club, and tells her that Chris is also in Bangkok. He then tries to tell her that Chris is remarried, but Kim interrupts. She is thrilled about the news and tells Tam that his father has arrived, believing that they are to go to America with Chris. Seeing Kim happy, John cannot bring himself to break the news to her, but promises to bring Chris to her (""Please"", replaced with ""Too Much for One Heart"" [same melody] in 2014 London revival).The Engineer tells Kim to find Chris herself, because he doubts that Chris will come (""Chris Is Here""). Kim is haunted by the ghost of Thuy, who taunts Kim, claiming that Chris will betray her as he did the night Saigon fell. Kim suffers a horrible flashback to that night (""Kim's Nightmare"").In the nightmare/flashback to 1975, Kim remembers the Viet Cong approaching Saigon. As the city becomes increasingly chaotic, Chris is called to the embassy and leaves his gun with Kim, telling her to pack. When Chris enters the embassy, the gates close, as orders arrive from Washington for an immediate evacuation of the remaining Americans. The Ambassador orders that no more Vietnamese be allowed into the Embassy. Kim reaches the gates of the Embassy, one of a mob of terrified Vietnamese trying to enter. Chris calls to Kim and is about to go into the crowd to look for her. John is eventually forced to punch Chris in the face to stop him from leaving. Chris is put into the last helicopter leaving Saigon as Kim watches from outside, still pledging her love to him (""The Fall of Saigon"").Back in 1978 Bangkok, Kim joyfully dresses in her wedding clothes (""Sun and Moon [Reprise]"") and leaves the Engineer to watch Tam while she is gone. She goes to Chris's hotel room, where she finds Ellen. Ellen reveals that she is Chris's wife.  Kim is heartbroken and refuses to believe Ellen. Ellen asks Kim if Chris is the father of Tam, and Kim confirms that he is. Kim says that she does not want her son to continue living on the streets and pleads that they take Tam with them back to America, but Ellen refuses, saying that Tam needs his real mother, and Ellen wants her own children with Chris. Kim angrily demands that Chris tell her these things in person, and runs out of the room (""Room 317""). Ellen feels bad for Kim, but is determined to keep Chris (""Now That I've Seen Her"", originally ""Her or Me"", replaced with ""Maybe"" [completely new lyrics and melody] for the 2011 Dutch revival).Chris and John return, having failed to find Kim. Ellen tells them both that Kim arrived and that she had to tell Kim everything. Chris and John blame themselves, realising that they were gone too long. Ellen also tells them that Kim wants to see Chris at her place, and that she tried to give away her son to them. John realises that Kim wants Tam to be ""an American boy."" Ellen then issues an ultimatum to Chris: Kim or her. Chris reassures Ellen, and they pledge their love for each other. Chris will leave Tam and Kim in Bangkok but offer them monetary support from America. John warns that Kim will not find it acceptable to have Tam stay in Thailand (""The Confrontation""). Back at the club, Kim lies to the Engineer that they are still going to America (""Paper Dragons""). The Engineer imagines the extravagant new life that he will lead in America (""The American Dream""). Chris, John, and Ellen find the Engineer and he takes them to see Kim and Tam.In her room, Kim tells Tam that he should be happy because he now has a father. She tells him that she cannot go with him but will be watching over him (""This Is the Hour [Reprise]"", referred to as ""Little God of My Heart"" on the 2014 London revival recording, though those words are not contained in the lyrics). Chris, Ellen, John, and the Engineer arrive just outside her room. The Engineer comes in to take Tam outside to introduce Tam to his father. While this is happening, Kim steps behind a curtain and shoots herself. As she falls to the floor, everyone rushes into the room at the sound of the gunshot and find Kim mortally wounded. Chris picks up Kim and asks what she has done. She asks him to hold her once more and repeats something that he said to her on the first night they met: ""How in one night have we come so far?"" and dies in his arms as he cries her name (""Finale"").","April 1975.

oklahoma,"  Act I In Oklahoma Territory, in 1906, cowboy Curly McLain looks forward to the beautiful day ahead as he wanders into farm girl Laurey Williams's yard (""Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin'"").  He and Laurey tease each other, while her Aunt Eller looks on. There will be a box social dance that night, which includes an auction of lunch baskets prepared by the local women to raise funds for a schoolhouse. The man who wins each basket will eat the lunch with the lady who prepared it. Curly asks Laurey to go with him, but she refuses, feeling that he has waited too long.  He attempts to persuade her by telling her that he will take her in the finest carriage money can buy (""The Surrey with the Fringe on Top""), but she teases him about it until he says he made it up to get back at her. She flounces off, not realizing that he really has rented such a rig.The lonely, disturbed farm hand Jud Fry has become obsessed with Laurey and asks her to the dance.  She accepts to spite Curly, although she is afraid of Jud.  Meanwhile, cowboy Will Parker returns bedazzled and souvenir-laden from a trip to modern Kansas City (""Kansas City"").  He won $50 ($1,400 today) at the fair, which, according to his girlfriend Ado Annie's father, Andrew Carnes, is the money he needs to marry Ado Annie.  Unfortunately, he spent all the money on gifts for her. Will also purchased a ""Little Wonder"" (a metal tube used for looking at pictures, but with a hidden blade inside) for Ado Annie's father, unaware of its deadly secret. Later, Ado Annie confesses to Laurey that while Will has been away, she has been spending a lot of time with Ali Hakim, a Persian peddler.  Laurey tells her she'll have to choose between them, but Ado Annie insists she loves them both (""I Cain't Say No"").  Laurey and her friends prepare for the social, while Gertie Cummings flirts with Curly (her obnoxious laugh floating in to taunt Laurey).  Laurey tells her friends that she doesn't really care about Curly (""Many a New Day"").Andrew Carnes discovers Annie with Ali Hakim.  After questioning Ado Annie about their relationship, he forces Hakim at gunpoint to agree to marry her.  Hakim and the other men lament the unfairness of the situation (""It's a Scandal! It's a Outrage!"").  Curly discovers that Laurey is going to the box social with Jud and tries to convince her to go with him instead.  Afraid to tell Jud she won't go with him, Laurey tries to convince Curly (and herself) that she does not love him (""People Will Say We're in Love"").  Hurt by her refusal, Curly goes to the smokehouse where Jud lives to talk with him.  Curly suggests that since Jud does not feel appreciated, he could hang himself, and everyone would realize how much they care about him (""Pore Jud Is Daid"").  Their talk turns into an ominous confrontation about Laurey. After Curly leaves, Jud's resolve to win Laurey becomes even stronger, and he vows to make her his bride (""Lonely Room"").Confused by her feelings for Curly and her fear of Jud, Laurey purchases a ""magic potion"" (referred to as smelling salts, but actually laudanum) from Ali Hakim, which the unscrupulous peddler guarantees will reveal her true love.  She muses on leaving her dreams of love behind and joining the man she loves (""Out of My Dreams""), then falls asleep under the influence of the opiate (""Dream Sequence""). In an extended dream ballet sequence, Laurey first dreams of what marriage to Curly would be like.  Her dream takes a nightmarish turn when Jud appears and kills Curly. She cannot escape him, confused by her desires.  The dream makes her realize that Curly is the right man for her, but it is too late to change her mind about going to the dance with Jud; he has come for her, and they leave for the box social. Act II At the social, during an upbeat square dance (""The Farmer and the Cowman""), the rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys over fences and water rights has led to fighting, which Aunt Eller ends by firing a gun to silence everyone. Laurey is upset when she sees Curly at the dance with Gertie. In an effort to rid himself of Ado Annie, Ali Hakim buys Will's souvenirs from Kansas City for $50. Jud also contributes to this by purchasing Will's Little Wonder, knowing of the blade concealed within it. The auction starts and Will bids $50 on Ado Annie's basket, not realizing that without the $50, he would no longer have the money her father insisted he needs to ""purchase"" marriage with her.  Desperate to be rid of Ado Annie, the peddler bids $51 to get the basket so that Will can approach Andrew Carnes with the $50 and claim Ado Annie as his bride. The auction becomes much more serious when Laurey's basket comes up for auction.  Jud has saved all his money so he can win Laurey's basket. Various men bid, trying to protect Laurey, but Jud outbids them all. Curly and Jud engage in a ferocious bidding war, and Curly sells his saddle, his horse, and even his gun to raise money.  Curly outbids Jud and wins the basket.  Jud discreetly tries to kill Curly with the Little Wonder, but his plan is foiled when Aunt Eller (knowing what is happening) loudly asks Curly for a dance.  Later that night, Will and Annie work out their differences, as she reluctantly agrees not to flirt with other men (""All Er Nuthin'"").Jud confronts Laurey about his feelings for her.  When she admits that she does not return them, he threatens her.  She then fires him as her farm hand, screaming at him to get off her property.

Next to Normal,"  Act I Diana Goodman, a suburban mother suffering from bipolar disorder, stays up late awaiting the return of her son Gabe, who has broken curfew. Also awake is Diana’s daughter Natalie, an overachieving high school student who is stressfully studying for an upcoming test. Diana encourages her daughter to take a break and rest, and soon after, Gabe returns home and Diana’s husband Dan awakes to help the family prepare for the day (“Just Another Day”). Diana prepares a meal for her family, but Dan and Natalie stop her when they realize the sandwiches she is making cover every surface of the kitchen. As Dan helps the disoriented Diana, Natalie and Gabe leave for school. Natalie releases some pent-up anger and frustration as she practices for an upcoming piano recital in the school’s music room (“Everything Else”), where she meets Henry, a fellow classmate who has been admiring Natalie from afar. Meanwhile, Diana repeatedly visits her psychiatrist’s office where she is prescribed a variety of medications, though they all prove to cause debilitating physical side effects; Dan waits through her appointments in the car while he questions his own sanity (“Who’s Crazy?/ My Psychopharmacologist and I”). When Diana is given a medication which numbs and rids her of all feelings, the doctor pronounces her stable and sends her on her way. After witnessing a romantic moment between Natalie and Henry (“Perfect For You”), Diana mourns the loss of her old life, longing for the days she lived in both pain and joy, as opposed to the numbness her new medication has caused (“I Miss the Mountains”). At Gabe’s suggestion, she flushes her medications. Meanwhile, Dan arranges a family dinner, inviting Henry to join them (“It’s Gonna Be Good”). When Diana brings to the table a cake for Gabe’s birthday, Dan gently reminds her that Gabe in fact died nearly sixteen years ago, and her visions of him throughout the show have only been hallucinations (""He's Not Here""). After an upset Natalie runs to her bedroom, Dan clears off the dinner table while Diana reveals to him she has stopped her medication. As he tries to empathize with her, she becomes angry, saying he could not possibly understand the pain she is going through (“You Don’t Know”). Dan begs her to let him help however he can, reminding her of his faithfulness and patience thus far, but is interrupted by a vision of Gabe, whom only Diana can see. Diana immediately clings to her son, rejecting Dan’s offer of comfort (“I Am the One”). Upstairs, Natalie vents to Henry over her mother’s attachment to the dead Gabe over her (“Superboy and the Invisible Girl”). Diana overhears their conversation and offers the only comfort she is capable of giving, telling Natalie, “I love you as much as I can.”  Diana visits a new doctor, who performs talk therapy and hypnosis on her. During their session, she sees Gabe, who asserts his dominance over her and the control he has in her life (""I'm Alive""). Diana reveals intimate details about the effects of her illness, saying that she was unable to hold Natalie in the hospital when she was born. Meanwhile, Natalie botches an important piano recital upon discovering her parents are not in the audience (“Make Up Your Mind/ Catch Me I’m Falling”). Diana’s doctor encourages her to go home, spend time with Natalie, and clean out a box of Gabe’s old things in an attempt to let him go. Diana agrees but is confronted with a hallucination of Gabe while sorting through a box in their basement (“I Dreamed a Dance”). Gabe convinces her to commit suicide, saying it is the only way they can be together (“There’s a World”). Diana is hospitalized after her suicide attempt fails, and Dan is told by Dr. Madden that electro-conclusive therapy is one of the only options they have left. Dan returns home to clean up the scene of his wife’s attempt at suicide, narrowly avoiding a breakdown of his own as he reminisces about the years spent with Diana (“I’ve Been”). Natalie finds him and is angry to discover that he has agreed to the doctor’s recommendation of shock therapy. Upon returning to the hospital, he finds that Diana has become aggressive with the staff for wanting her to sign the confirmation papers, likening the idea of shock therapy to its depiction in the film One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest (“Didn’t I See This Movie?”). However, after clearing the room of doctors, he manages to convince her of the necessity of this treatment, saying it is the only way they can get back to normal (“A Light in the Dark”). Reluctantly, Diana agrees and signs the papers, embracing Dan as the first act comes to a close. Act II Diana receives a series of ECT treatments over two weeks. Meanwhile, Natalie experiments with drugs and frequently goes clubbing, being rescued most nights by Henry, who sees her home safely. On one occasion, she seems to share a hallucination with her mother (“Wish I Were Here”). Upon Diana’s return home from the hospital, it is revealed that she has lost her memories of the last nineteen years due to the shock therapy - including the memory of her deceased son (“Song of Forgetting“). Henry, who has been finding Natalie passed out at clubs and driving her home, asks Natalie to the upcoming school dance, an invitation which she immediately declines (“Hey #1”). Meanwhile, Dan questions Dr. Madden over Diana’s memory loss, learning it is a relatively common side effect of ECT (“Seconds and Years”). Because Gabe’s death was the start of a lifetime of depression, Dan hesitates to remind her of it. At home, he and Natalie help Diana sort through a box of pictures and memories of her old life, leaving out any mention of Gabe’s existence (“Better Than Before”). However, Diana is briefly confronted afterward by Gabe, who hints that she has forgotten a vital part of her life (“Aftershocks”). Meanwhile, Henry once again invites Natalie to the dance, but is turned down again (“Hey #2). Diana visits Dr. Madden, who accidentally reveals the existence of her son, unaware that Dan has not yet done so (“You Don’t Know (reprise)”). After learning this, Diana returns home and searches through Gabe’s old belongings, finding the music box that helped him sleep as an infant.  When Dan finds her revisiting the night their son died, he reluctantly reminds her that their son had died of an illness all of the doctors missed (“How Could I Ever Forget?”). Diana confusedly admits she recalls hallucinating Gabe as a teenager, and Dan frantically says they will get her to the doctor and do more ECT (“It’s Gonna Be Good (reprise)”), which leads to a heated argument between the two that Natalie witnesses the peak of. After Natalie runs upstairs to her bedroom, where Henry is waiting to talk with her, Diana questions Dan as to why he stays, despite all of the things she puts him through and all the pain they have experienced together. He reminds her of their wedding vows and promises to see their relationship through, no matter how much she pushes him away. Upstairs, Henry makes a similar pledge to Natalie (“Why Stay?/A Promise”). However, Diana once again sees Gabe and is immediately entranced by him, drawn away from Dan (“I’m Alive - Reprise”). Though Dan begs her to stay, Diana leaves and visits Dr. Madden, frustrated that years of treatment haven’t seemed to improve her condition and wonders if her grief over losing her son should truly be medicated (“The Break”). Dr. Madden pleads with her to stay with him, recommending more shock treatment and other medications, but she leaves the appointment (“Make Up Your Mind/Catch Me I’m Falling (reprise)”). Upon returning outside, she connects with Natalie for the first time, noting the similarities between the two of them and truly making an effort to connect with her for possibly the first time. They embrace and agree that somehow they will get by, and Diana drives Natalie to the dance to meet Henry (“Maybe”). At the dance, Natalie voices her concerns to Henry that she will someday end up with the same issues as her mother, though Henry promises to stand by her no matter what, and the two kiss (“Hey #3/ Perfect For You (reprise)”).Diana returns home and tells Dan she is leaving him, saying that though she still loves him, they both must finally come to terms with their grief on their own (“So Anyway”). Devastated, Dan looks back on his years of faithfulness to her and sees Gabe for the first time. (“I Am the One (reprise)”). The two share an embrace, and Dan says his name for the first time in the course of the show. Gabe disappears, and Natalie returns home to find that her mother is gone. She continues her relationship with Henry, and Diana has moved in with her parents temporarily, still depressed but more hopeful than she’s ever been. Dan visits Dr. Madden, who gives him the name of another psychiatrist he can talk to. Gabe is seen by the audience one final time, this time relaying a message of hope as opposed to the threatening, ominous persona he has taken most of the show, and the family adjusts to their new way of life (“Light”).","Diana Goodman worried about her son Gabe. Natalie comforted her mother. In the morning, the husband of Diana decided that started an ordinary day. Everything was fine until Natalie & her father saw on the kitchen’s floor lying sandwiches. While husband helped his wife with cleaning, the adolescent went to school. She stopped practicing because of Henry’s arrival – he liked a girl & how she played piano.  Diana went to see her shrink. Husband was waiting for her in the vehicle, thinking about his gloomy mood. A wife for 16 years already has suffered from hard hallucinations. Dr. tried to help his wife, but improvements were not observed. Natalie began to meet with Henry. Seeing kissing daughter, a woman suddenly realized that the best years of her are already behind. Receiving support from her son, a woman got rid of medicines.  Henry was about to dine with Goodmans. When a mother came into the room with a cake, wishing her son happy birthday, all were pretty strongly confused. The woman saw her son only in own hallucinations. The man reminded her that the boy died in infancy. Diana refused to go to the doctor. Dan asked his wife to trust him, but son appeared in front of her, who wanted mother listened to his words. Natalie quarreled with Henry & did not accept an apology of mother. Diana wanted to be treated without any drugs & went to another doctor. Husband & daughter questioned the effectiveness of such method. After a quarrel, Natalie decided to try medications of mother. New doctor suggested women to go through hypnosis. It could help to clarify the reasons for her mental disorder. Natalie has lost faith in the importance of music lessons.  Once Diana decided that she had to let go of her son. Packaging his things, she took out the music box. Gabe appeared before her. Dancing with mother, he asked her to go with him. Diana tried to commit suicide. Dan learned that electroshock therapy is applied to patients-suicides. Soon, the woman screamed at the doctor, rejecting such treatment. But her husband was able to convince her to give her consent. Diana was treated 2 weeks by shock therapy. At this time, Natalie tried drugs. Once a woman has gone through electric therapy, she was starting to lose memory about the last 19 years of her life. Henry invited Natalie to spring dances.  Using the family belongings to return the memory of Diana, Dan decided that their daughter would help them. But the woman was unable to remember anything. When Natalie got music box, the father knocked it out of the hands of his daughter, leaving his wife confused. Diana told her husband that she is worried by some uncertain memories. Soon she noticed Henry, who had come to Natalie. Diana continued to explore personal belongings. Taking the music box out, she thought of son Gabe. Dan wanted his wife to re-passed treatment. The husband broke the jukebox, returning memory to mother of her son.  Faced with the doctor, the woman realized that not her mind is hurt but the soul. Diana refused to do electroshock therapy. Natalie was upset to learn that her mother would not continue treatment. Woman first openly talked with her daughter. She called Natalie go to the dance, where she was awaited by Henry. Soon, Diana told her husband that she leaves him to understand herself. When the woman left, the invisible son stayed with Dan. The husband was very upset. The teenager said that he would always be with him. Shocked father saw his son & called him by name. Back home, the daughter found father crying in the darkness. Switching on the light, she knew what was happening. Natalie told Henry that mother went to her parents & for the first time in many years, she felt hope."
The Producers,"  Act I In New York in 1959, theatre producer Max Bialystock opens ""Funny Boy"", a musical version of Hamlet (""Opening Night""). It is terrible, and the show closes after one performance. Max, who was once called the King of Broadway, tells a crowd of down-and-outs of his past achievements and vows to return to form (""King of Broadway"").The next day, Leo Bloom, a mousy accountant, comes to Max's office to audit his books. When one of Max's little old lady ""investors"" arrives, Max tells Leo to wait in the bathroom until she leaves. She plays a sex game with Max, who eventually persuades her to give him a check to be invested in his next play, to be called ""Cash"". Leo reveals his lifelong dream: he's always wanted to be a Broadway producer. After a panic attack when Max touches his blue blanket, Leo tells Max that he has found an accounting error in his books: Max raised $100,000 for ""Funny Boy"", but the play only cost $98,000. Max begs Leo to cook the books to hide the discrepancy. Leo reluctantly agrees. After some calculations, he realizes that ""under the right circumstances, a producer could actually make more money with a flop than he can with a hit. ... You could've raised a million dollars, put on your $100,000 flop, and kept the rest!"" Max proposes a scheme:However, Leo refuses to help Max with his scheme (""We Can Do It""). When he arrives at work six minutes late, Leo's horrid boss, Mr. Marks, reminds him that he is a nobody. While he and his miserable co-workers slave over accounts, Leo daydreams of becoming a Broadway producer (""I Wanna Be a Producer""). He realizes that his job is terrible, quits, and returns to Max (""We Can Do It"" (reprise)). The next day, they look for the worst play ever written. Max finds a sure-fire flop that would offend people of all races, creeds and religions: Springtime for Hitler: A Gay Romp with Adolf and Eva at Berchtesgaden, written by ex-Nazi Franz Liebkind, which Max describes as ""a love letter to Hitler"". They go to the playwright's home in Greenwich Village to get the rights to the play. Franz is on the roof of his tenement with his pigeons reminiscing about the grand old days (""In Old Bavaria""). The producers get him to sign their contract by joining him in singing Adolf Hitler's favorite tune (""Der Guten Tag Hop Clop"") and reciting the Siegfried Oath, under penalty of death, promising never to dishonor ""the spirit and the memory of Adolf Elizabeth Hitler"".Next, they go to the townhouse of flamboyant homosexual Roger De Bris, the worst director in New York. At first, Roger and his ""common law-assistant"" Carmen Ghia decline the offer to direct because of the serious subject matter (""Keep It Gay""). After much persuading and invoking the possibility of a Tony award, Roger agrees and tells them the second act must be rewritten so the Germans win World War II. Max and Leo return to the office to meet a Swedish bombshell who wants to audition for their next play: Ulla Inga Hansen Benson Yansen Tallen Hallen Svaden Swanson. She auditions for them (""When You've Got It, Flaunt It""). The producers are impressed, mostly by her sex-appeal, and hire her to be their ""secretary-slash-receptionist"". Max leaves to raise two million dollars for ""Springtime for Hitler"" by calling on all the little old ladies in New York (""Along Came Bialy""), which he does (""Act I Finale""). Act II Leo and Ulla are left alone in Max's office (redecorated by Ulla), and they start to fall in love (""That Face""). Max walks in and sees the perfect form of Ulla's covered behind (""That Face"" (reprise)).At the auditions for the title role, Hitler, one terrible actor after another is rejected by Roger in summary fashion. Finally, Franz performs his own jazzy rendition of ""Haben Sie Gehört Das Deutsche Band?"", at the end of which Max stands up and shouts, ""That's our Hitler!"" Opening night arrives (""It's Bad Luck to Say 'Good Luck' on Opening Night""), and Franz falls down the stairs and breaks his leg. Roger is the only one who knows the part of Hitler, and he rushes to the dressing room to get ready. The curtain rises, and Max and Leo watch the theatrical disaster unfold (""Springtime for Hitler""). Unfortunately, Roger's performance is so camp and outrageous, the audience mistakes it for satire, and the show becomes the talk of the town. Back at the office, Max and Leo are near-suicidal (""Where Did We Go Right?""). Roger and Carmen come to congratulate them, only to find them fighting over the accounting books. Franz bursts in, waving a pistol, outraged by Roger's portrayal of his beloved Führer. Max suggests that he shoot the actors (not the producers) as a way to close the show. The police hear the commotion and arrest Franz, who breaks his other leg while trying to escape. They also arrest Max and take the books. Leo hides; Ulla finds him and persuades him to take the two million dollars and run off to Rio with her.In jail awaiting trial, Max receives a postcard from Leo and, feeling betrayed, recounts the whole show (""Betrayed""). At his trial, Max is found ""incredibly guilty""; but the now-married Leo and Ulla arrive to tell the judge that Max is a good man who has never hurt anyone despite his swindling (""'Till Him""). The judge is touched by this and decides not to separate the partners, sending both (plus Franz) to Sing Sing prison for five years. In prison, they write a new musical entitled Prisoners of Love, which goes to Broadway (""Prisoners of Love"") (starring Roger and Ulla), and they are pardoned by the Governor. Leo and Max become the kings of Broadway and walk off into the sunset (""Leo & Max""). Everyone comes back for one last song, telling the audience that they have to leave (""Goodbye""). Differences from the original film The film is set in the year it was released, 1967, while the musical takes place in 1959. Because of this, the character ""Lorenzo Saint DuBois"", also known as L.S.D was omitted from the show, and Franz took the role of Hitler; Roger takes over the role after Franz breaks his leg. Ulla has a bigger role in the musical, and the overall tone of the musical is more lighthearted with a happier ending. The song ""Heil Myself"" was not included in the Broadway production, although it can be included in licensed revivals.","The action of the musical starts with the failed version of “Hamlet”. The performance is closed after the first night. The creator tells about his talents and past achievements. He claims that he will do his best next time and return to form. The accountant visits his office for auditing. Suddenly an old and wealthy woman comes to the main character. In a seducing game, he convinces her to invest some money in his next play. We also find out that the accountant has always dreamt of becoming a Broadway producer. He tells that there is a mistake in the main character’s books. After some minutes of persuading, he agrees to hide these facts.  The main hero understands that failed shows are much more profitable, as you can keep lots of money. He offers a scheme to the accountant. He proposes to hire the worst director and actors, choose the worst play and get two million – one for each of them. After the performance is closed on Broadway, they can escape. But the accountant refuses. After being humiliated by his boss, the book-keeper keeps dreaming about becoming a producer. He decides to support the main hero in his plan. They are looking for the worst play. They finally find one about Hitler. They are sure it will offend everyone. They cone to the author to get a right for staging. The producers make him to sign a contract. Then they visit the worst director, who is also a homosexual. They convince him to participate by promising great success. The director asks to change the second act in order to make the Germans winners of the war. The main character is searching for money. They also hire a new beautiful secretary. The book-keeper starts to fall in love with her.  We observe the audition. The author of the play is chosen to act as Hitler. But he breaks his leg. The director takes his place on the stage. The producers watch their disastrous spectacle. But the director’s play looks as satire, and people start talking about the performance. The two men start fighting being upset with the result. The author is angry with the director’s acting and comes with a pistol. The main character proposes to kill the actors. The writer is arrested as well as the main hero. His accounting books are taken for inspection. The accountant manages to hide. The secretary offers him to run away with the money. They send a postcard to the prison, which makes the leading character feel betrayed. Then they appear in the court to save him. Both producers are sent to prison, where they create a new musical. It becomes a hit, which turns them into the kings of Broadway."
Gypsy: A Musical Fable,"  Act I Rose and her two daughters, Baby June and Louise, play the vaudeville circuit around the United States in the early 1920s. Rose, the archetype of a stage mother, is aggressive and domineering, pushing her children to perform. While June is an extroverted, talented child star, the older girl, Louise, is shy. The kiddie act has one song, ""May We Entertain You"", that they sing over and over again, with June always as the centerpiece and Louise often as one of the ""boys"" (""Baby June and Her Newsboys""). Rose has big dreams for the girls but encounters setbacks, such as attempting to borrow money from her father (""Some People""). When Rose meets a former agent, Herbie, she persuades him to become their manager using her seductive and feminine wiles (""Small World""). The girls grow up, and June, now billed as Dainty June, and her act have a chance to perform for Mr. Goldstone of the Orpheum Circuit (""Mr. Goldstone, I Love You""). Meanwhile, Louise celebrates her birthday alone and asks her birthday present, a lamb, just how old she is this year (""Little Lamb""). After Rose rejects Herbie's marriage proposal, he considers leaving, but she asserts that he could never get away from her (""You'll Never Get Away From Me"").Now billed as ""Dainty June and Her Farmboys"", the act finally performs on the Orpheum Circuit (""Dainty June and Her Farmboys""). June is soon offered a place at a Performing Arts school after an audition. However, Rose turns this down, refusing to break up the act. Louise and June fantasize what life would be like if Rose were married and finished with show business (""If Momma Was Married""). A few months later, still on the road from show to show, Tulsa, one of the boys from the act, confides in Louise that he has been working on his own act (""All I Need Is the Girl""), and Louise fantasizes that she and he could do the act together. Shortly after, June is missing, and in a note, she explains that she has grown sick of her mother and the endless tour and has eloped with Tulsa, and they will do a new act. Rose is hurt, but then optimistically vows that she will make Louise a star, proclaiming that ""Everything's Coming up Roses"". Act II Louise is now a young woman, and Rose has built a pale imitation of the Dainty June act for her. Using all girls, Rose and Herbie try valiantly to sell ""Madame Rose's Toreadorables"" to a fading vaudeville industry. However, they are still together (""Together, Wherever We Go""). With no vaudeville venues left, Louise and her second-rate act wind up accidentally booked at a burlesque house in Wichita, Kansas, as a means to deter police raids. Rose is anguished, as she sees what a booking in burlesque means to her dreams of success, but Louise persuades her that two weeks' pay for the new act is better than unemployment. As they are introduced to Louise, three of the strippers on the bill advise her on what it takes to be a successful stripper, a ""gimmick,"" something that ""makes your strip special"" (""You Gotta Get a Gimmick""). Backstage, Rose proposes marriage to Herbie. He asks her to break up the act and let Louise have a normal life, and she reluctantly accepts, agreeing to marry the day after their show closes. On the last day of the booking, the star stripper in the burlesque show is arrested for solicitation. Desperate, Rose cannot resist the urge to give Louise another nudge toward stardom, and she volunteers Louise to do the strip tease as a last-minute replacement. Louise is sad at what she's being pushed to do for her mother's love and Herbie is disgusted at how low Rose has stooped and he finally walks out on her (""Small World"" (Reprise)). Although reluctant, Louise goes on, assured by Rose that she needn't actually strip, but simply walk elegantly and tease by dropping a single shoulder strap. Shy and hesitant, she sings a titillating version of the old kiddie act song, ""May We Entertain You?"". She removes only her glove, but she speaks directly to her 'audience', which becomes her ""gimmick"" (""Let Me Entertain You"" ""(Gypsy Strip Tease)"").Louise becomes secure, always following her mother's advice to ""Make 'em beg for more, and then don't give it to them!"" The song becomes brasher and brassier, and more and more articles of clothing come off. Ultimately, Louise becomes a major burlesque star and does not need her mother any longer. Rose and Louise, who has become the sophisticated ""Gypsy Rose Lee"", have a bitter argument. Rose, feeling sad, useless and bitter, reveals that the true motivation for all her actions has been to live vicariously through her daughters, to chase the stardom she wanted for herself, not her children (""Rose's Turn""). She realizes that she has driven away June, Herbie, and now possibly Louise. She displays the talent that could have been under different circumstances, as the name ""Rose"" flashes in neon lights.  After her admission to Louise, mother and daughter tentatively move toward reconciliation in the end.In the 1974 and 2008 Broadway revivals, although the final dialogue scene remains, there is not a happy ending, but rather a bleak, sad one as all hopes of reconciliation for Rose and Louise fall flat when Louise walks away, laughing sarcastically at Rose's new ""dream."" The audience is then left with a Rose whose dream of her own lit up marquee slowly fades away to her unrealistic dreams.In the 2003 revival starring Bernadette Peters, the final dialogue scene remains, but leaves the ending open to more interpretation from the audience. Louise walks through the stage door, with Rose following behind. Rose then turns to face the audience, a look of sadness and longing on her face as she takes one last look at the empty stage. She pauses and slowly closes the door.In the 2015 West End revival starring Imelda Staunton, Louise begins to walk out, and Rose catches up after waking up to reality. Louise puts her arm around Rose as they exit together, giving the appearance that Louise is now taking care of Rose.","Action of the musical happens in the twenties. Mother and her two daughters, June and Louise, go on tour across America. Rose is very strict and exacting to girls. She forces them to act. Elder sister June is very beautiful and talented. Younger sister is very modest; therefore, she plays a supporting role of the boy-postman. She sings only one song all the time.  Rose lays hopes on girls, but constantly faces with failures. Once she meets the agent and persuades him to become the manager for her daughters. She uses her charm and cunning. Time passes, the girls are already adult. June has an opportunity to act at Goldstone. Louise celebrates her birthday alone. The manager suggests Rose to marry him, but she refuses. He plans to leave.  June, at last, acts in front of the large audience. She is also invited to school of arts, but the mother forbids her to give up performances. Sisters dream of their mother married and threw the career.  On one of shows, they meet the boy, who says to Louise that he would like to create his own project. The girls want to join it. After a while, June runs with this boy. The girl explains that she is too tired of pressure of her mother and tiresome tour. Now Rosa lays all her hopes on the younger daughter.  Louise plays the roles similar to June’s. On the one of performances, she attracts representatives of the burlesque house. Her mother is in despair, but Louise considers that it is better than practically not to have money.  Herbie suggests Rose to leave the daughter and to begin the normal life. She doesn’t agree with him. Before performance, Rose advises Louise that she shouldn't be undressed, she can simply tease a public. At first, the girl sings the song of her childhood. Then she takes off a glove. She also addresses to all audience. These things become her distinctive features.  During the next months, Louise follows Rose's advice and teases public. However, music becomes more and more defiant, and clothes, after all. The girl becomes the main star of a burlesque.  Rose understands that nobody needs her help. She starts thinking about youth and glory, which could belong to her. She is consoled by Louise. They are reconciled."
Dreamgirls," summary Act I: 1960sIn 1962, The Dreamettes, a hopeful black girl group from Chicago, enter the famous Amateur Night talent competition at the Apollo Theater in Harlem, New York (""I'm Lookin' for Something"", ""Goin' Downtown"", ""Takin' the Long Way Home""). The group is composed conducted of full-figured lead singer Effie White and best friends, Deena Jones and Lorrell Robinson. For the contest, the Dreamettes sing ""Move (You're Steppin' on My Heart)"", a song written by Effie's brother, C.C., who accompanies them to the talent show. Unfortunately, they lose the talent show, but backstage, the girls and C.C. meet Curtis Taylor, Jr., a car salesman who becomes the Dreamettes' manager.Curtis convinces James ""Thunder"" Early, a popular R&B star, and his manager, Marty, to hire The Dreamettes as backup singers. Though Jimmy Early and the Dreamettes' first performance together is successful (""Fake Your Way to the Top""), Jimmy is desperate for new material. Curtis convinces Jimmy and Marty that they should venture beyond traditional rhythm and blues and soul audiences and aim for the pop market. C.C. composes ""Cadillac Car"" for Jimmy and the Dreamettes, who tour (""Cadillac Car (On the Road)"") and record the single upon their return (""Cadillac Car (In the Recording Studio)""). ""Cadillac Car"" makes its way up the pop charts, but a cover version by white pop singers Dave and the Sweethearts (""Cadillac Car"" (Reprise)) steals the original recording's thunder. Angered by ""Cadillac Car's"" usurpation, Curtis, C.C., and Jimmy's producer, Wayne, resort to payola, bribing disc jockeys across the nation to play Jimmy Early and the Dreamettes' next single, ""Steppin' to the Bad Side"". As a result, the record becomes a major pop hit. Conflict arises between Marty and Curtis when Curtis moves in on Marty's turf: Jimmy Early. Things become more complicated when Effie begins dating Curtis, and Jimmy, a married man, begins an affair with Lorrell (""Party, Party"").Curtis replaces him, strongly determined to make his black singers household names. Curtis attempts to transform Jimmy Early into a Perry Como-esque pop singer (""I Want You Baby""), and concentrates on establishing the Dreamettes as their own act, renaming them The Dreams, changing their act to give them a more sophisticated and pop-friendly look and sound. The most crucial of these changes is the establishment of Deena as lead singer, instead of Effie. Effie is resentful of her change in status within the group. C.C. convinces her to go along with Curtis's plan (""Family""). After a fight between Marty and Curtis, Marty quits as Jimmy's manager and Curtis takes over. The Dreams make their club debut in the Crystal Room in Cleveland, Ohio, singing their first single (""Dreamgirls""). After a triumphant show, the press is eager to meet the newly minted stars (""Press Conference""). Curtis declares to Deena, ""I'm going to make you the most famous woman who's ever lived,"" as the slighted Effie asks ""What about me?"" (""Only the Beginning""). Over the next few years, the Dreams become a mainstream success with hit singles (""Heavy""). As Deena is increasingly feted as a star, Effie becomes temperamental and unpredictable. She suspects Curtis and Deena of having an affair. Lorrell attempts to keep peace between her bandmates, but the task seems difficult.In 1967, the group – now known as ""Deena Jones and the Dreams"" – is set to make their Las Vegas début. However, when Jimmy stops by to visit the girls (""Drivin' Down the Strip""), he learns from the others that Effie has been missing shows because of illness (it is later revealed that she was pregnant with Curtis's child). Curtis and Deena are convinced that she is trying to sabotage the act. Curtis replaces Effie with a new singer, Michelle Morris, a young girlfriend change about which Effie learns before anyone has a chance to tell her. Effie confronts Curtis, C.C., and the group (""It's All Over""), but despite her personal appeal to Curtis (""And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going""), the heartbroken Effie is left behind as Deena Jones and the Dreams forge ahead without her (""Love Love Me Baby"").Act II: 1970sBy 1972, Deena Jones and the Dreams have become the most successful girl group in the country (""Act II Opening""1). Deena has married Curtis, and C.C. is in love with Jackie. Jimmy has gone years without a hit. Curtis shows little interest in updating or revitalizing Jimmy's act because of Curtis's preoccupation with Deena and because of Jimmy's habit of sneaking funk numbers into his repertoire of pop-friendly songs. Effie is back in Chicago, a single mother to her daughter, Magic (or Ronald in other versions), struggling to get another break. Marty, who is now her manager, compels her to rebuild her confidence and give up her ""diva behaviors."" Once she does, Effie is able to make a show business comeback (""I Am Changing""). In contrast to Effie's struggling return to her musical career, Deena wants to stop singing and become an actress. Deena informs Curtis of her career plans during a Vogue photo shoot (""One More Picture Please""), but Curtis refuses to let her go (""When I First Saw You""). Deena is not the only one chafing under Curtis's control: C.C. is enraged by Curtis's constant rearrangements of his songs, including an emotional ballad, entitled ""One Night Only"", which Curtis wants instead recorded to reflect the ""new sound"" he is inventing.Deena Jones and the Dreams and Jimmy Early perform at a National Democratic fundraiser, on a bill featuring such groups as The Five Tuxedos (""Got to Be Good Times""). While waiting backstage to go on, Jimmy finds himself in another argument with Lorrell as to the nature of their relationship and when, or if, Jimmy will tell his wife about their affair (""Ain't No Party""). Lorrell is in tears as Jimmy takes to the stage to perform, and turns to Deena for support. As Jimmy pleads to Lorrell through his music (""I Meant You No Harm""), Deena tries to help Lorrell successfully resolve her situation, and Jackie convinces the artistically frustrated C.C. to go find his sister and reconcile with her (""Quintette""). Midway through ""I Meant You No Harm"", Jimmy falls apart and decides that he ""can't sing any more sad songs."" Desperate to keep his set going, Jimmy launches into a wild, improvised funk number (""The Rap""), dropping his pants during the performance. An embarrassed Curtis fires Jimmy as soon as his set concludes (""Firing of Jimmy""). Lorrell ends her affair with Jimmy as well. The heartbroken Jimmy fades into obscurity, refusing to ""beg"" for Curtis' help.Marty arranges for C.C. to meet and reconcile with Effie at a recording studio (""I Miss You, Old Friend""). C.C. apologizes for his role in handicapping her career, and Effie records C.C.'s ""One Night Only"" in its original ballad format. ""One Night Only"" begins climbing the charts, causing an enraged Curtis not only to rush-release Deena and the Dreams' version, but to use massive amounts of payola to push Deena's version up the charts and Effie's version down (""One Night Only (Disco)""). Effie, C.C., and Marty discover Curtis's scheme and confront him backstage at a Dreams concert, threatening legal action (""I'm Somebody"", ""Chicago/Faith in Myself""). As Curtis makes arrangements with Effie's lawyer to reverse his wrongdoings, Effie and Deena reconcile, and Deena learns that Effie's daughter Magic is Curtis's child. Realizing what kind of a man Curtis really is, Deena finally finds the courage to leave him and live her own life (""Listen"" 2). Effie's ""One Night Only"" becomes a number-one hit, as the Dreams break up so that Deena can pursue her movie career (""Hard to Say Goodbye, My Love""). For the final number of the Dreams' farewell concert, Effie rejoins the group on stage, and all four Dreams sing their signature song one last time (""Dreamgirls (Reprise)"").","Two acts of the play take place in 1960s and 1970s, respectively. The first act begins in 1962, when the newly formed music band of black singers, trio, becomes a member of the local talent competition. Despite the bright show, they lose it, but get acquainted with the producer, which in the future will lead them to the heights of success. Producer deals with one in the past big celebrity, who now experiences a decline that he should hire a band them to be on his back vocals. Their first joint show turns successful, but at the same time, this elderly star experiences a desperate shortage of new materials, performing songs of R’n’B and soul styles. Producer of a band persuaded him and his agent that it's time to forget about his old fans in these genres and to begin to move on a new path, in the genre of pop. They agree, and gradually their cooperation with a band begins to pace up.

"Hello, Dolly!"," Sources: Tams-Witmark Guide to Musical Theatre Masterworks Broadway Act I As the nineteenth becomes the 20th century, all of New York City is excited because widowed but brassy Dolly Gallagher Levi is in town (""Call on Dolly""). Dolly makes a living through what she calls ""meddling"" – matchmaking and numerous sidelines, including dance instruction and mandolin lessons (""I Put My Hand In"").  She is currently seeking a wife for grumpy Horace Vandergelder, the well-known half-a-millionaire, but it becomes clear that Dolly intends to marry Horace herself.  Ambrose Kemper, a young artist, wants to marry Horace's weepy niece Ermengarde, but Horace opposes this because Ambrose's vocation does not guarantee a steady living.  Ambrose enlists Dolly's help, and they travel to Yonkers, New York to visit Horace, who is a prominent citizen there and owns Vandergelder's Hay and Feed.Horace explains to his two clerks, Cornelius Hackl and Barnaby Tucker, that he is going to get married because ""It Takes a Woman"" to cheerfully do all the household chores.  He plans to travel with Dolly to New York City to march in the Fourteenth Street Association Parade and propose to the widow Irene Molloy, who owns a hat shop there.  Dolly arrives in Yonkers and ""accidentally"" mentions that Irene's first husband might not have died of natural causes, and also mentions that she knows an heiress, Ernestina Money, who may be interested in Horace.  Horace leaves for New York and leaves Cornelius and Barnaby to run the store.Cornelius decides that he and Barnaby need to get out of Yonkers.  They'll go to New York, have a good meal, spend all their money, see the stuffed whale in Barnum's museum, almost get arrested, and each kiss a girl!  They blow up some tomato cans to create a terrible stench and a pretext to close the store.  Dolly mentions that she knows two ladies in New York they should call on: Irene Molloy and her shop assistant, Minnie Fay.  She tells Ermengarde and Ambrose that she'll enter them in the polka competition at the upscale Harmonia Gardens Restaurant in New York City so Ambrose can demonstrate his ability to be a breadwinner to Horace.  Cornelius, Barnaby, Ambrose, Ermengarde and Dolly take the train to New York (""Put on Your Sunday Clothes"").Irene and Minnie open their hat shop for the afternoon.  Irene wants a husband, but does not love Horace Vandergelder.  She declares that she will wear an elaborate hat to impress a gentleman (""Ribbons Down My Back"").  Cornelius and Barnaby arrive at the shop and pretend to be rich.  Horace and Dolly arrive at the shop, and Cornelius and Barnaby hide from him.  Irene inadvertently mentions that she knows Cornelius Hackl, and Dolly tells her and Horace that even though Cornelius is Horace's clerk by day, he's a New York playboy by night; he's one of the Hackls.  Minnie screams when she finds Cornelius hiding in the armoire.  Horace is about to open the armoire himself, but Dolly, Irene and Minnie distract him with patriotic sentiments related to subjects like Betsy Ross and The Battle of the Alamo shown in the famous lyrics ""Alamo, remember the Alamo!"" (""Motherhood March""). Cornelius sneezes, and Horace storms out, realizing there are men hiding in the shop, but not knowing they are his clerks.Dolly arranges for Cornelius and Barnaby, who are still pretending to be rich, to take the ladies out to dinner to the Harmonia Gardens restaurant to make up for their humiliation.  She teaches Cornelius and Barnaby how to dance since they always have dancing at such establishments (""Dancing"").  Soon, Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby, and Minnie are happily dancing.  They go to watch the great 14th Street Association Parade together.  Alone, Dolly decides to put her dear departed husband Ephram behind her and to move on with life ""Before the Parade Passes By"".  She asks Ephram's permission to marry Horace, requesting a sign from him.  Dolly catches up with the annoyed Vandergelder, who has missed the whole parade, and she convinces him to give her matchmaking one more chance.  She tells him that Ernestina Money would be perfect for him and asks him to meet her at the swanky Harmonia Gardens that evening. Act II Cornelius is determined to get a kiss before the night is over, but Barnaby isn't so sure.  As the clerks have no money for a carriage, they tell the girls that walking to the restaurant shows that they've got ""Elegance"".  At the Harmonia Gardens Restaurant, Rudolph, the head waiter, prepares his service crew for Dolly Gallagher Levi's return: their usual lightning service, he tells them, must be ""twice as lightning"" (""The Waiters' Gallop"").  Horace arrives with his date, but she proves neither as rich nor as elegant as Dolly had implied; furthermore she is soon bored by Horace and leaves, as Dolly had planned she would.Cornelius, Barnaby, and their dates arrive, unaware that Horace is also dining at the restaurant.  Irene and Minnie, inspired by the restaurant's opulence, order the menu's most expensive items. Cornelius and Barnaby grow increasingly anxious as they discover they have little more than a dollar left. Dolly makes her triumphant return to the Harmonia Gardens and is greeted in style by the staff (""Hello, Dolly!"") She sits in the now-empty seat at Horace's table and proceeds to eat a large, expensive dinner, telling the exasperated Horace that no matter what he says, she will not marry him. Barnaby and Horace hail waiters at the same time, and in the ensuing confusion each drops his wallet and inadvertently picks up the other's. Barnaby is delighted that he can now pay the restaurant bill, while Horace finds only a little spare change.  Barnaby and Cornelius realize that the wallet must belong to Horace. Cornelius, Irene, Barnaby and Minnie try to sneak out during ""The Polka Contest"", but Horace recognizes them and spots Ermengarde and Ambrose as well. The ensuing free-for-all culminates in a trip to night court.Cornelius and Barnaby confess that they have no money and have never been to New York before. Cornelius declares that even if he has to dig ditches the rest of his life, he'll never forget the day because he had met Irene. Cornelius, Barnaby, and Ambrose then each profess their love for their companion (""It Only Takes A Moment""). Dolly convinces the judge that their only crime was being in love. The judge finds everyone innocent and cleared of all charges, but Horace is declared guilty and forced to pay damages. Dolly mentions marriage again, and Horace declares that he wouldn't marry her if she were the last woman in the world.  Dolly angrily bids him ""So Long, Dearie"", telling him that while he's bored and lonely, she'll be living the high life.The next morning, back at the hay and feed store, Cornelius and Irene, Barnaby and Minnie, and Ambrose and Ermengarde each set out on new life's paths.  A chastened Horace Vandergelder finally admits that he needs Dolly in his life, but Dolly is unsure about the marriage until her late husband sends her a sign.  Vandergelder spontaneously repeats a saying of Ephram's: ""Money is like manure. It's not worth a thing unless it's spread about, encouraging young things to grow.""  Horace tells Dolly life would be dull without her, and she promises in return that she'll ""never go away again"" (""Hello, Dolly"" (reprise)).","The story takes us to a time when one age goes after another. Time is inexorable, humanity is on the threshold of a new century, the development of new technologies, a completely different time & the problems are still the same: where do you find a beautiful & unique love, lasting for life? Then happens familiarity with Dolly Levi. She is a successful matchmaker, a middle-aged widow with an active & joyful lifestyle. She is responsible to carry out orders of her clients & to introduce the most appropriate people to each other. What problems, as it would seem, could have a person, who all hers life deftly picked out of the crowd two, at the first glance, not similar to each other people, condemning them to a happy marriage? About that says this musical.  Once Dolly meets a new client – Horace Vandergelder. He is handsome, rich & successful, but loneliness always gnaws him. Initially, Dolly finds for Horace a good young girl, recently widowed (Irene Molloy), but then she realizes that Horace & his sharacter could become her own perfect companion in life, which also requires strong male hands. Irene is charming & fun-loving girl, she needs romance & a gentleman husband. She works in a hat shop in Big Apple, where they are introduced. Along it, the production introduces us not only with the named characters, but also with his shop in Yonkers, as well as with his 2 employees.  Horace comes in own shop & says to the guys that he will depart to find a wife, who will help him with household chores. By that time, Dolly learned a man closer & realizes that she doesn’t want to fulfill the contract completely & to give this man away to other womenfolk. On the way to New York, she if casually mentions that the ex-husband of Irene perhaps, did not die from a natural death & the amiable & charming Irene knows about his condition & inheritance.  At the same time, two clever & freedom-loving workers of Horace decide that they definitely are obliged to arrange themselves a holiday, but they need an alibi for the time of absence of the chief. & because of it they make sabotage: blow up in the store cans of tomatoes, causing the air to become unclean for a long time & taking advantage of this, to justify their absence & run away to look at the big city.  But as soon as the guys get to New York, they instantly decide that they have to pretend to be rich & interesting guys, to find girls for their small weekend. They come in a hat store to choose new things, pretending to be young sons of rich person. By accident, this is the store of Irene & for a long time, they have time to talk & get to know each other to make a good impression & one of the guys, Cornelius, falls in love with a girl. But everything is not so simple. The bell on the door tinkles & interrupts the conversation: Horace & Dolly enter in the store. Irene, without thinking twice, hides the fellows in the back, meeting her fiancé. During a conversation, a girl inadvertently mentions that knows Cornelius & in a day he just a worker in Horace's store, but at night, a young man conquers the nightlife of the city. Then an assistant of Irene stumbles upon Cornelius, hiding in the closet. Horace knows that there is someone in the store, but Irene cleverly tries to write off all on the mice. Dodgy Dolly understands what is happening & of some maternal feelings distracts her client, so that he did not find his own workers in the closet of his young bride. But one of them sneezes & Horace realizes that he had been deceived, stating that he knew that she dragged men into the shop. The engagement is broken, but Irene does not regret – she did not particularly want to be married to a callous & domineering Horace.  Dolly finds the boys in the shop of Irene and, to compensate their humiliation, says she knows two beautiful ladies in New York, desperately wanting a date with the men. Later, she has time to teach manners to younglings, along with etiquette & dance, urgently, so that they could fulfill their little dream. Dolly catches irritated Horace & uses all her skills & talents to win Horace, who, in the end, casts aside his callousness & admits that he requires the presence of Dolly in his life. Cornelius & Barnaby get disillusioned with the secular life & return to the store of Irene, where Cornelius recognized in his feelings to her."
Jersey Boys,"  Act I Spring""Ces soirées-là"", a modern pop-rap song that was released in 2000, is performed. Tommy DeVito arrives, introduces himself and explains how the song is a cover of The Four Seasons' ""December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)"". He offers to tell the story of the band, explaining how he started out with the group ""The Variety Trio"" with his brother Nick DeVito and friend Nick Massi, eventually discovering teenager Frankie Castelluccio and taking him under his wing, teaching him everything he knows (""The Early Years: A Scrapbook""). During these early years Nick Massi helped train Frankie to sing, Tommy went in and out of prison, Frankie changed his last name to Valli, Tommy and Frankie developed a good relationship with mob boss Gyp DeCarlo, and Frankie fell in love with and married Mary Delgado. Musically, the band was still struggling and kept changing their name and sound but without any dramatic success. One day friend and fellow Jersey boy Joe Pesci comes up to Tommy and says that he knows a singer-songwriter who'd make the perfect fourth for their band: Bob Gaudio.SummerBob Gaudio takes over the narration, telling the audience that no matter what Tommy says, he was not plucked from obscurity by him, since he already had a hit single with ""Short Shorts"". Bob goes with Joe Pesci to see the band perform, and is immediately impressed by Frankie's voice. Bob performs a song he had just written: ""Cry for Me"" on piano, which Frankie, Nick Massi and then Tommy joining in with vocals, bass and guitar respectively. They negotiate an agreement, though Tommy is at first skeptical that Bobby (then still a teenager) will be good for the band. The band eventually gets a contract with producer Bob Crewe but only to sing back-up (""Backup Sessions""). Crewe insists that the band has an ""identity crisis"" and needs to make a firm decision on a name and a sound. The band name themselves after The Four Seasons bowling alley, and Bobby writes them three songs that finally propel them to stardom: ""Sherry"", ""Big Girls Don't Cry"" and ""Walk Like a Man"". In the wake of their success, Bob also chalks up a personal first by losing his virginity (""December, 1963 (Oh, What a Night)""). The band's success means that they tour a lot more, along the way discovering the girl band The Angels (""My Boyfriend's Back""). Unfortunately, the constant touring strains Frankie's marriage to Mary, and they eventually divorce (""My Eyes Adored You""). The band continues to enjoy chart successes (""Dawn (Go Away)"") until after a concert the band is approached by a loan shark out to claim money owed by Tommy (""Walk Like a Man (reprise)""). Act II FallNick Massi, taking over as Narrator, explains that Bob was so focused on the band's musical success and future that he could not see that the band had been in trouble for some time. Tommy has been racking up debts, and a forgotten bill during a previous tour lands the band in jail over the weekend, which strains things between Tommy and Bob (""Big Man in Town""). Nick observes that Tommy became jealous of Frankie's success and closeness with Bobby, and attempted to seduce Frankie's new girlfriend Lorraine. The two never confronted each other about it, but the old friendship was not what it used to be. When the loan shark approaches the band for the $150,000 owed by Tommy, Frankie goes to Gyp DeCarlo for help despite Tommy's insistence that he does not need it (""Beggin'""). The band, Gyp, and the loan shark come to agreement: Tommy is to be ""sequestered"" in Las Vegas where the mob can keep an eye on him, and the band will willingly cover the debt, along with an additional half a million in unpaid taxes that Tommy kept hidden from the group. At this time, Nick declares that he is tired of everything and wants out, despite Frankie and Bob trying to convince him to stay (""Stay/Let's Hang On!"").WinterFrankie takes over narration, explaining that though he owes Tommy a great deal, he is aware that their relationship was not ideal, and he never understood why Nick decided to leave. Frankie and Bob find replacements to keep the band a quartet (""Opus 17 (Don't You Worry 'Bout Me)"") until Bobby announces that he has never been comfortable in the spotlight and that Frankie should be a single, i.e. Frankie Valli and the Four Seasons. In his personal life, Frankie's relationship with his daughter Francine is strained and he breaks up with girlfriend Lorraine (""Bye, Bye, Baby (Baby, Goodbye)""). Frankie continues to have success thanks to Bobby's songs, and hits jackpot with ""C'mon Marianne"" and the almost-never-released ""Can't Take My Eyes Off You"" which Bobby fights to get airplay for. Along with the success of ""Working My Way Back to You"", Frankie and Bobby finally finish paying off Tommy's debts, and Frankie's life is good until his daughter Francine dies from a drug overdose (""Fallen Angel"")FinaleBob Crewe describes The Four Seasons' 1990 induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which reunited the original four members on stage one last time (""Rag Doll""). Each member takes a moment to address the audience in turn, explaining his pride at having been with the band and briefly notes what he did afterwards (""Who Loves You"").","The whole spectacle is divided into five parts: spring, summer, autumn, winter and the final. This seems a very bold move, the same as logical. Spring is the dawn of a great band, yet unknown, when quite young guys just get to know each other and trying to figure out this life. They come in a variety of troubles, linked with the Mafia, and, finally, find themselves as artists. Summer is expressed in the work within the team, acquaintances and attempt to mutual understanding. Guys are trying to do their best, sing songs together, deciding who and what will do. To put it simply, work out the team work, which, truthfully, only sounds easy. This is shown in a part of the musical, where they try to overcome the ego of each other, staying on the road that leads to a common goal. And, of course, the first successes and concerts end with a full sensation.  There could not, of course, be without problems and confusions, especially in the personal life of men, who became famous, now the idols of many women. And one of them as a result of this, is going through a difficult break-up with his wife. And there comes a ""fall"". Famous and recognizable, they traveled on tours across the country. One of them cares about the success of the whole band and is literally drowning in own work and not noticing the other participants in respect of which all is not as rosy as it would like to be. Debts, glory’s hardships and constant performances, attempts to save the crumbling friendship, women. All of this is sinking in endless faceless crowd of fans, for which you need to play the role of a simple guy, who do not have any problems.  Winter period in the play is at all the most difficult. The band breaks up in front of our eyes. One member of the team leaves the band, because of fatigue. Games are over. The real life, without crowds of fans and autographs, already may seem a dream. Men understand that it is all of their friendship that seemed so strong and true, and it is crashing down with a great name of their band. The problems are multiplying and spreading. It becomes much more difficult not to pay attention to them, not to notice them in the stream of crazy days. They recognize that their relationship has never been ideal, but still earnestly trying to help each other. Everything completely falls apart when from a drug overdose daughter of one of the band’s members dies. The team keeps afloat brilliance and relevance of their songs for a certain time, but the mood is already quite gloomy. Eventually, the band breaks up.  In the final part, in the conclusion, the song sounds, uniting the four soloists for the last time on the stage, and each participant during the execution snatches a moment to address a speech to the audience."
Oliver!,"  Act I The musical opens in the workhouse, as the half-starved orphan boys are entering the enormous dining room for dinner. They are fed only gruel, but find some solace by imagining a richer menu, (""Food Glorious Food""). Oliver gathers up the courage to ask for more. He is immediately apprehended and is told to gather his belongings by Mr. Bumble and the Widow Corney, the heartless and greedy caretakers of the workhouse (""Oliver!""). Mr. Bumble and Widow Corney are left alone, and Mr. Bumble begins to make amorous advances. Mrs. Corney pretends to resent his attentions, but ends up on Mr. Bumble's lap, as he eventually proposes to her (""I Shall Scream!""). Mr. Bumble then takes Oliver and sells him as an apprentice to an undertaker, Mr. Sowerberry (""Boy for Sale""). He and his wife taunt Oliver and Mr. Bumble (""That's Your Funeral""), causing Mr. Bumble to become angry and storm out. Oliver is sent to sleep in the basement with the coffins (""Where Is Love?"").The next morning Noah Claypole, another employee of Sowerberry, insults Oliver's dead mother, whereupon Oliver begins pummeling him. Mrs. Sowerberry and her daughter, Charlotte, also Noah's girlfriend, run in, and Mr. Bumble is sent for. He and the Sowerberrys lock Oliver in a coffin, but during all the commotion Oliver escapes. After a week on the run, he ends up in the city of London and meets a boy about his age known as the Artful Dodger. Dodger seems a kindly boy, and invites Oliver to join him and his friends (""Consider Yourself""). Dodger is, unknown to Oliver, a pickpocket, and he invites Oliver to come and live in Fagin's lair. Fagin is an elderly criminal, now too old to thieve himself, who now teaches young boys to pick pockets. Oliver is completely unaware of any criminality, and believes that the boys make handkerchiefs rather than steal them. Oliver is introduced to Fagin and his boys, and is taught their ways (""You've Got to Pick a Pocket or Two"").The next day, Oliver meets Nancy, an older member of Fagin's gang, and the live-in wife of Fagin's terrifying associate Bill Sikes, a brutal house-burglar whose abuse she endures because she loves him. Nancy, along with her younger sister Bet and the boys, sing about how they don't mind a bit of danger (""It's a Fine Life""). Oliver bows deeply to Nancy and Bet, trying to be polite. All the boys laugh and mimic Oliver. Nancy singles out Dodger to demonstrate the way the rich people treat each other (""I'd Do Anything""). Nancy and Bet leave and Oliver is sent out with the other boys on his first pickpocketing job (""Be Back Soon""). Dodger, another boy named Charley Bates, and Oliver decide to stick together, and when Dodger and Charley rob Mr. Brownlow, a wealthy old man, they run off, leaving the horrified Oliver to be arrested for the crime (""The Robbery""). Act II In the Three Cripples pub, to help take her mind off of Sikes's neglect towards her, Nancy strikes up an old tavern song with the low-life ruffians, (""Oom-Pah-Pah""). Bill Sikes makes his first appearance, and disperses the crowd (""My Name""). Dodger runs in and tells Fagin about Oliver's capture and removal to the Brownlow household. Scared he will betray the gang's whereabouts, Fagin and Bill decide to abduct Oliver and bring him back to the den, with Nancy's help. Nancy, who has come to care for Oliver, at first refuses to help, but Bill physically abuses her and forces her into obedience. In spite of this, Nancy still loves Bill, and believes he loves her too (""As Long as He Needs Me"").The next morning, at Mr. Brownlow's house in Bloomsbury, Mrs. Bedwin the housekeeper sings to Oliver (""Where Is Love? [Reprise]""), and Oliver wakes up. Mr. Brownlow and Dr. Grimwig decide that Oliver is well enough to go outside, so Brownlow sends Oliver to return some books to the library. Oliver sees a group of street vendors and joins them in song (""Who Will Buy?""). As the vendors leave, Nancy and Bill appear and grab Oliver. They bring him back to Fagin's den, where Nancy saves Oliver from a beating from Sikes after the boy tries to flee. Nancy remorsefully reviews their dreadful life, but Bill maintains that any living is better than none. Fagin tries to act as an intermediary (""It's A Fine Life [Reprise]""). Left alone, Fagin wonders what his life might be like if he left London and began an honest life (""Reviewing the Situation""); however, after thinking of various excuses, he elects to remain a thief.Back at the workhouse, Mr. Bumble and the Widow Corney, now unhappily married, meet the dying pauper Old Sally and another old lady, who tell them that Oliver's mother, Agnes, left a gold locket when she died in childbirth. Old Sally stole the locket, which she gives to the Widow Corney. Mr. Bumble and Widow Corney, realizing that Oliver may have wealthy relatives, visit Mr. Brownlow, who has advertised in newspapers for news of him, hoping to profit from any reward given for information (""Oliver! [Reprise]""). Mr. Brownlow realises they are not interested in Oliver's welfare, but only money, and throws them out, but recognizes the picture inside the locket as a picture of his daughter, and realizes that Oliver is actually his grandson.Nancy visits Mr. Brownlow, explains how she and Bill abducted Oliver, and remorsefully promises to deliver Oliver to him safely that night on London Bridge. She ponders again about Bill (""As Long as He Needs Me [Reprise]""). Suspecting that Nancy is up to something, Bill follows her as she sneaks Oliver out of Fagin's den. At London Bridge, he confronts them, knocks Oliver unconscious, and clubs Nancy to death. He then grabs Oliver and runs off. Mr. Brownlow arrives and discovers Nancy's body. A large crowd forms, among them the distraught Bet. Bullseye, Bill's terrier, turns on his master and returns to the scene of the crime and the crowd prepares to follow him to the hideout. Fagin and his boys leave their hideout in panic. Not finding Bill at the hideout, the crowd returns to the Thames Embankment. Bill appears at the top of the bridge, holding Oliver as hostage and threatening to kill him. Two policemen sneak up on him. One of them shoots Bill and the other grabs Oliver. After Oliver is reunited with Mr. Brownlow, the mob disperses offstage in order to track down Fagin. He appears and decides that the time has never looked better for him to straighten out his life (""Reviewing the Situation [Reprise]"").","When living in a workhouse, orphan Oliver dared to ask for addition of food, wardens said that he should gather his belongings and to get out. Mr. Bumble and Widow Corney sold the boy to local mortician. Oliver spent the night in the basement. In the morning, an assistant of mortician insulted boy's dead mother and has paid for his words – Oliver began to beat a hell out of him. Undertaker, his wife and the maid tried to catch the boy, but he managed to escape from them. A week later, wandering the streets of London, Oliver met with the Artful Dodger. They were of the same age. Dodger asked the boy to go with him into the lair of Fagin. He, old criminal, taught children how to steal, because he could not do it himself due to old age. The unsuspecting Oliver went along with Dodger. He thought that these children made handkerchiefs.  Oliver met Nancy in the morning – adult gang member. She was a mistress of burglar Bill. When he bowed politely to her, the other children laughed at him. Soon Nancy left. Oliver went to the boys, who went on to work. Dodger and Charley robbed old Mr. Brownlow. Seeing this, the boy froze in horror. His new friends have escaped but Oliver was arrested, accused in robbing of a rich old man. From the court, the boy was saved by the testimony of a witness who saw how it all happened. Dodger ran to Fagin. He told him that Oliver was arrested and now the boy is in the house of Mr. Brownlow. Criminals were afraid – they thought that a child could tell of their lair. Fagin and Bill decided to steal the boy outta there. They forced Nancy to take part in it.  Mr. Brownlow asked Oliver to carry books to the library. Outside, the boy did not notice that he was approached by Nancy & Bill. Criminals captured Oliver and dragged him back into the den. His attempt to escape failed. Nancy repented of her behavior, but Bill did not see anything wrong – that was their life. Fagin thought that he could stop criminal living and become an honest worker. But, finding a lot of arguments against it, the old man decided to remain the leader of the gang. Wardens met old Sally. The dying beggar gave them her gold medallion, which she stole from Agnes, Oliver’s mother, who died during childbirth. Realizing that the boy may have rich relatives, wardens began to search for him. They visited Mr. Brownlow, who was looking missing child through a newspaper. Old man realized promptly that these people didn’t care about the boy. He took the medallion and chased them away. Opening the decoration, Mr. Brownlow saw inside of a portrait of his daughter. Oliver was his grandson.  Soon to Mr. Brownlow came Nancy. She said that the boy was kidnapped. The woman promised to get the child to the London’s Bridge. When Nancy was taking Oliver, Bill suspected something and followed her. On the bridge, he scored a woman to death. Criminal took fainted Oliver with him. Arriving at the venue, Mr. Brownlow saw the body of the murdered Nancy. A large crowd gathered soon. People noticed the labeled dog of Bill, who was looking for the owner. Following her, they came to the lair of Fagin. The old man managed to escape together with his assistants. People have returned to the bridge. Suddenly there appeared Bill – he threatened to kill the child. The two policemen managed to save Oliver – they shot the offender’s dead. The boy was reunited with Mr. Brownlow. At this time, pursued Fagin has decided to begin an honest life."

After a black-out, the tribe enters worshiping in an attempt to summon Claude (""Oh Great God of Power""). Claude returns from the induction center, and tribe members act out an imagined conversation from Claude's draft interview, with Hud saying ""the draft is white people sending black people to make war on the yellow people to defend the land they stole from the red people"".  Claude gives Woof a Mick Jagger poster, and Woof is excited about the gift, as he has said he's hung up on Jagger.  Three white women of the tribe tell why they like ""Black Boys"" (""black boys are delicious ...""), and three black women of the tribe, dressed like The Supremes, explain why they like ""White Boys"" (""white boys are so pretty ..."").Berger gives a joint to Claude that is laced with a hallucinogen.  Claude starts to trip as the tribe acts out his visions (""Walking in Space"").  He hallucinates that he is skydiving from a plane into the jungles of Vietnam.  Berger appears as General George Washington and is told to retreat because of an Indian attack. The Indians shoot all of Washington's men.  General Ulysses S. Grant appears and begins a roll call: Abraham Lincoln (played by a black female tribe member), John Wilkes Booth, Calvin Coolidge, Clark Gable, Scarlett O'Hara, Aretha Franklin, Colonel George Custer.  Claude Bukowski is called in the roll call, but Clark Gable says ""he couldn't make it"".  They all dance a minuet until three African witch doctors kill them – all except for Abraham Lincoln who says, ""I'm one of you"".  Lincoln, after the three Africans sing his praises, recites an alternate version of the Gettysburg Address (""Abie Baby"").  Booth shoots Lincoln, but Lincoln says to him, ""I ain't dying for no white man"".As the visions continue, four Buddhist monks enter.  One monk pours a can of gasoline over another monk, who is set afire (reminiscent of the self-immolation of Thích Quảng Đức) and runs off screaming. Three Catholic nuns strangle the three remaining Buddhist monks. Three astronauts shoot the nuns with ray guns.  Three Chinese people stab the astronauts with knives.  Three Native Americans kill the Chinese with bows and tomahawks.  Three green berets kill the Native Americans with machine guns and then kill each other.  A Sergeant and two parents appear holding up a suit on a hanger.  The parents talk to the suit as if it is their son and they are very proud of him.  The bodies rise and play like children.  The play escalates to violence until they are all dead again. They rise again and comment about the casualties in Vietnam: ""It's a dirty little war"" (""Three-Five-Zero-Zero""). At the end of the trip sequence, two tribe members sing, over the dead bodies, a melody set to a Shakespeare speech about the nobility of Man (""What A Piece of Work Is Man"").After the trip, Claude says ""I can't take this moment to moment living on the streets. ... I know what I want to be ... invisible"".  As they ""look at the moon,"" Sheila and the others enjoy a light moment (""Good Morning Starshine"").  The tribe pays tribute to an old mattress (""The Bed""). Claude is left alone with his doubts.  He leaves as the tribe enters wrapped in blankets in the midst of a snow storm.  They start a protest chant and then wonder where Claude has gone.  Berger calls out ""Claude! Claude!""  Claude enters dressed in a military uniform, his hair short, but they do not see him because he is an invisible spirit.  Claude says, ""like it or not, they got me.""Claude and everyone sing ""Flesh Failures"".  The tribe moves in front of Claude as Sheila and Dionne take up the lyric.  The whole tribe launches into ""Let the Sun Shine In"", and as they exit, they reveal Claude lying down center stage on a black cloth.  During the curtain call, the tribe reprises ""Let the Sun Shine In"" and brings audience members up on stage to dance.(Note: This plot summary is based on the original Broadway script.  The script has varied in subsequent productions.)","The musical tells the story of a certain tribe of people, of the small-sized pride, which grouped persons by common interests – of antiwar sensation, love for different medications, expanding consciousness and free love. Musical is about hippies, ""flower’s children"". Events unfolding with presentation of the tribe and the musical’s hallmark is the fact that the actors move freely among the spectators, mingling with the crowd.  First are the two – high school student-activist and a young man, expresses the freedom of spirit and thought. In the middle of the stage, sits alternately one then the other person, and they often asked by other participants of their changing social group, to make accents. One of the actors appears in a loincloth, and another one says that he is from England, making the fake British accent, while he reminded that he really is from the state of New York. Some of them are dark-skinned, and others are passionately listing medications.  Then in the middle is an eccentric woman who, we believe, is against all the achievements of mankind, as they lead to death, and she doesn’t even know by whom she was impregnated, but apparently, not from whom she would like to have a baby. Participants stand in letters, first FBI, then CIA and then – LSD. Then the participants imitate the speech of one of the parents of these loafers – he does not work, collects some paper trash and they decide to send him to the army and not to sponsor his idle life. He contradicted them, gathering with his odd pals to celebrate that he's alive. In short, he is a loggerhead. Then he still goes to the medical examination of military service in the army and he is given a card, with which he must go to Vietnam, but he does not want such development. At this time, the others continue to be addicted to drugs and take them to have a buzz.  Then they answer the question of why hippies have long hair. It turns out that because a natural and long hair is like a bird's feathers, because they do not cut it (well, not surprising – they don’t have scissors). One of the girls said that the people and their children should be absolutely free, as long as it does not harm anyone. Then the tribe undresses and gets engaged into jumble coitus, reciting that the true values are freedom, happiness and flowers. At the same time, they make jokes about the American flag, handing out leaflets to the public, calling to participate in their orgy, and summarize that love of all with all is natural event.  One of them describes the tribe's call to war as a desire of white to send black to kill yellow, protecting the lands, taken from the red. Approximately in the brain of most inhabitants of North America, the world looks like this: there are countries such as the US, Canada and Europe and some wild tribes, such as Africa and Asia. And yet somewhere it is Japan, which makes electronics for IPhones. Then all declare love for each other, despite the color of the skin. Two of them smoke a hallucinogen and begin to fantasize about the war from different ages. Then start some phantasmagorical theatricals, where politicians and Hollywood stars are mixed together in a pile. Someone shoots Lincoln, but he refuses to die.  After visions retreat, someone goes away, someone is engaged in physical love, and someone goes out, in the middle of a snowstorm, covered only in a sheet. One of them pretends to be invisible, but the Army's hand reaches for & picks him, despite his protests. Then everyone starts dancing and the curtain closes."
Something Rotten,"  Act I The ""musical"" opens with ""The Minstrel"" welcoming the audience to the English Renaissance (""Welcome to the Renaissance""). He tells the audience that ""not everybody is getting what he wants"", referring to Nick Bottom, who runs a theatre troupe with his brother Nigel. They are rehearsing for their upcoming play ""Richard II"", while William Shakespeare (referred to as ""The Bard"") is opening Romeo and Juliet. Lord Clapham, a patron who trusts the brothers and raises funds for their troupe, enters to announce that Shakespeare is doing ""Richard II"". The news outrages Nick, as Shakespeare has already done ""Richard III"", and the thought of going backwards seems absurd to him. He rants about his hatred of Shakespeare to the troupe members, who are horrified (""God, I Hate Shakespeare""). Lord Clapham leaves, telling the brothers he is stopping their funds unless they have another play by the next morning.Nigel and Nick go home to their small house, and on the way Nick encounters Shylock the Jew. Shylock expresses a desire to help fund the troupe, but Nick rejects him as it is illegal to employ a Jew. Bea, Nick's wife, tells them the events of her day and how she acquired their dinner as she serves it. They are saving for a better life, and when Nick tries to open the Money Box, Bea smacks his hand away. Bea tells him how she could help them out, but Nick is ambivalent (""Right Hand Man""). Despite Nick's arguments, Bea goes out to do jobs that Nick claims are for men. As Nigel sleeps, Nick faces the real reason he hates Shakespeare: ""The Bard"" makes Nick feel self-conscious (""God, I Hate Shakespeare (Reprise)""). He wishes there was a way to top Shakespeare, and steals from the Money Box to see a soothsayer. He finds a soothsayer named Thomas Nostradamus (the nephew of the famous soothsayer Nostradamus). Nick asks him what the next big thing in theatre will be, and Nostradamus says that it will be ""A Musical"", a play where ""an actor is saying his lines, and out of nowhere he just starts singing...."" Nick thinks it is ridiculous but quickly warms up to the idea (""A Musical"").Later, Nick meets Nigel on the street. Nigel has just met Portia, a Puritan and the daughter of Brother Jeremiah, and they immediately fall in love. Nick tells him that he shouldn't pursue her because she is a Puritan. The Puritans leave and Nick tells Nigel what the soothsayer said, but neglects to tell him that it was not Nick's own idea. Nigel wants to do ""The Brothers from Cornwall"", the story of the two brothers' lives, but Nick vetoes saying it has to be bigger, and decides to do a play about the Black Death. The troupe performs a song for Lord Clapham (”The Black Death”), who is disgusted and deserts the troupe.Nigel sits down to try to write a new play. Portia sneaks out to see him, and they discover more about their similarities, especially in the way they both love poetry. (""I Love the Way""). A messenger arrives with an invitation for Nigel to attend ""Shakespeare in the Park"" and an after-party. Nigel explains to Portia that he sent one of his sonnets to The Bard for feedback. Nigel asks the messenger if Portia can be his ""plus one"".In the park, Shakespeare performs for the people (""Will Power""). Nigel and Portia go to the after party, where Portia gets drunk. Shakespeare asks to read Nigel's journal of poems and writings, but Nick runs in with Shylock and chastises Shakespeare for trying to steal Nigel's ideas, as well reprimanding Nigel for his naiveté. Brother Jeremiah then runs in to find a drunk Portia and once again admonishes Nigel.In a rage, Nick goes back to Nostradamus with what he has left of the money he stole from the Money Box. He asks Nostradamus to tell him what Shakespeare's new hit is going to be, and Nostradamus sees ""Hamlet"", but misinterprets it as ""Omelette"", among other mistakes (such as the Prince eating a danish pastry rather than being a Danish prince). He gets excited at the possibilities of success and dreams of a future in which crowds cheer for him and Shakespeare bows down to him (""Bottom's Gonna Be on Top""). Act II The Minstrel welcomes the audience back and tells them of the stresses that the Bottom brothers and Shakespeare face (""Welcome to the Renaissance (Reprise)""). Shakespeare shows the stress he faces while trying to write hits and manage his fame (""Hard To Be The Bard""). A spy tells him that the brothers are trying to steal Shakespeare's upcoming hit. An excited Shakespeare decides to disguise himself as ""Toby Belch"" and audition for the brothers' troupe in order to steal the play. Meanwhile, the troupe is rehearsing ""Omelette: The Musical"" (""It's Eggs!""). Shylock has become their new investor, though they cannot find a title that would make his role legal. When some of the actors become suspicious of Nostradamus and why he is at their theatre, Nick lies and says that Nostradamus is an actor. ""Toby Belch"" arrives at the theatre and is hired for the company. He is surprised to learn that his hit is about eggs.Nigel sneaks out to London Bridge to see Portia, where he reads her another poem about his love for her. He worries about their future together, but Portia reassures him by saying that everyone, even Nick and Brother Jeremiah, will change their minds about their relationship when they hear Nigel's beautiful sonnets (""We See the Light""). Nigel is not very happy with ""Omelette"" and claims that it doesn't feel right. Brother Jeremiah interrupts the lovers and takes Portia away to be imprisoned in a tower for disobeying. Saddened by the loss of his love, Nigel becomes inspired to write a completely different play that is revealed to be Hamlet.Nigel goes into the theatre the next day and tells Nick about his new improvements. They get into a huge argument and Shakespeare tries to take advantage of their squabble to get his hit (""To Thine Own Self""). A hurt Nigel scrambles out onto the street and is confronted by Shakespeare, who steals his hit under the guise of ""improving it"". Later, Nigel runs into Bea, who explains to him that they should still trust Nick because they can always fall on him if they need him (""Right Hand Man"" (Reprise)).Nick is having qualms about ""Omelette: The Musical"" as well, but dismisses these doubts once he learns that the town lined up all the way around the theatre for tickets. He and the troupe prepare for the show (""Something Rotten!""). Once the audience arrives, they perform a bombastic dance number that has many references to modern-day musicals (such as The Lion King and The Phantom of the Opera) (""Make an Omelette""). Towards the end of the number, Shakespeare reveals himself and sues the brothers. The troupe and Nigel find out that Nostradamus is a soothsayer, and are horrified.In court, Shylock, Nick, Nigel, and Nostradamus are on trial and Nick is sentenced to beheading. Bea enters, disguised as a lawyer, and makes Nick confess that he stole from the Money Box, and tells the judge that beheading him would be redundant because he has already lost his head. She has made a deal with Shakespeare that they will be exiled to America (""To Thine Own Self"" (Reprise)). She says that they always wanted a new country house and they are getting a house in a new country. Portia then arrives, having escaped the tower. She renounces her father's ideals and joins the Bottoms, Shylock, and Nostradamus in exile.They arrive in America and tell the audience of the new opportunities in the New World (""Finale""). Nick hears about the opening of Shakespeare's new masterpiece, Hamlet, to which Nostradamus replies ""I was this close"".","In 1590-ies, William Shakespeare was nicknamed as The Bard. Minstrel told the audience the story of two brothers Bottom, who managed the theater troupe. Their patron Lord Clapham announced that the play ‘Richard II’, which was under the maintenance of Nigel & Nick, would be prepared by Shakespeare. Relatives’ indignation knew no bounds – they knew that the playwright has already created the next part of this story and return to the previous one, according to them, was unacceptable. Lord said that if by tomorrow they would not have a new song, he’ll cease to support the theater of Bottoms.  Returning home, Nick & Nigel met yet another sponsor, who wanted to invest in their production, but according to the law had no right to do so, because he was a Jew. When Nick was trying to take money out of a home piggy bank, he received a comeuppance from his wife. Eventually, the man managed to get to these coins in several days. Bottom was going to go to Nostradamus, to find out what production is required to defeat the hated Shakespeare. Going to the nephew of the famous soothsayer, Nick found out – it is necessary to make a play in which everyone would sing. The idea seemed to choreographer funny, but he decided to follow the advice of Nostradamus. Faced with Nigel, Bottom made him to turn off the puritan girl, with whom he had flirting.  After Portia left, joyful Nick told a sibling to create a musical, omitting that he was advised to do so by Nostradamus. Argue a bit about what kind of performance they would do, the brothers decided on ‘The Black Death’ play as the best option. Their patron was very unhappy with the behavior of the company and the choice of the title song for the musical. Nigel had decided to write a new play, but was distracted by entered Portia. They together went to a party organized by Shakespeare – the young man received an invitation by sending his poems to The Bard. After a while, there came Nick. He pulled out a sonnet of brother off Shakespeare's hands, accusing the latter in plagiarism.  Soon, Nick went to Nostradamus again. The playwright wanted to find out what new hit will Shakespeare prepare for the show. Misinterpreting the name ‘Hamlet’, the prophet said, that it would be called ‘Omelet’. He also said that the histrionics would tell about the Danish dough. In his dreams, Nick saw himself beating a hated rival. At this time, Shakespeare has learned from a spy that the brothers were hunting after his hit. Trying to find an idea for a new play, playwright disguised himself and implemented in the company of competitors. Naming himself Toby Belch, he learned that the brothers would stage a thing about the eggs. Its production covertly was funded by Shylock the Jew.  Nigel did not like about the idea of the omelet, and he began to write a new play about Hamlet. When the playwright told this brother about it, they had a skirmish that was overheard by Shakespeare. During the premiere, The Bard took off his disguise and accused Nick and Nigel in plagiarism – in their musical were many references to other plays. The court sentenced the brothers, Shylock and Nostradamus to exile in America. Along with them went Bea & Portia. In the New World Nick heard that Shakespeare created the play ‘Hamlet’. Nostradamus was glad that his visions were so close to the truth."

Ragtime," Act OneThe musical introduces the American experience at the turn of the 20th century through the eyes of three different facets of society, in the New York City area.  The first is an upper-class white family from New Rochelle—Mother, Father, Mother's Younger Brother, Grandfather, and the Little Boy, Edgar. Theirs is a genteel, sheltered atmosphere, far from the bustle of Harlem, where the African-American community, including a beautiful young woman named Sarah, explores a new kind of music pioneered by a pianist named Coalhouse Walker Jr.  Meanwhile, immigrants from all parts of the globe set out to seek better lives in the tenements of the Lower East Side, among them Tateh, a Jewish artist from Latvia, and his young daughter. These three disparate worlds are connected only by celebrities: tycoons such as J.P. Morgan and Henry Ford, activists such as Booker T. Washington and Emma Goldman, and entertainers such as Harry Houdini and Evelyn Nesbit, who has been catapulted into fame by the murder of her wealthy lover Stanford White by her millionaire husband Harry K. Thaw. As the century dawns, the separate worlds of New York City begin to blur together (“Prologue—Ragtime”).Mother and her Family say goodbye to Father as he embarks on Robert Peary's expedition to the North Pole. He asks Mother to oversee his affairs, her first experience with any kind of independence. He assures her that nothing will change in his absence but Mother, feeling adrift without dreams of her own, hopes differently (“Goodbye, My Love”).  On board Admiral Peary's ship, Father encounters the ship's First Officer, Matthew Henson, and is shocked to find he is a black man. He catches a glimpse of the rag ship carrying Tateh and his Little Girl to America and waves at the immigrants, who he cynically imagines ""don't have a chance"" in America. Tateh, incredulous anyone would want to leave such a wonderful country as America, returns the hail, while Mother, back on shore, also wishes Father a safe passage  (“Journey On”).Mother's Younger Brother, an intense, awkward young man, is consistently in search of something fulfilling in life, and his latest obsession is Evelyn Nesbit. He takes a regular seat in the balcony of the vaudeville theatre where Evelyn performs her act, a risqué parody of her husband's murder trial (“Crime of the Century”).  After the show ends, Younger Brother confesses his love to Evelyn.  She kisses him, but only for the benefit of a press photographer, cheerfully rejecting him once he has served his purpose.Back at the family's home in New Rochelle, Mother discovers a black newborn baby who has been buried alive in her garden.  The police arrive with Sarah, the baby's mother, and on an impulse Mother takes responsibility for both Sarah and her child. She marvels both at her newfound compassion and at the realization that her husband would never have allowed her to make such a decision were he present (“What Kind of Woman”).At Ellis Island, the immigrants arrive at their new home (“A Shtetl Iz Amereke”). Tateh eagerly begins his new life, drawing silhouettes and selling them from a street corner cart, but he quickly finds the American Dream not so readily accessible. Emma Goldman attempts to get him to join the Socialist movement, but he is determined to leave politics alone. The Little Girl grows ill and Tateh rapidly becomes destitute. A low point comes when a wealthy stranger offers to buy the Little Girl from him, and he snaps, cursing his new country. Inspired by the success of immigrant magician Harry Houdini, Tateh resolves to sell his cart and begin again somewhere else (“Success”).The people of Harlem dance to Coalhouse's music (“His Name Was Coalhouse”) and he sings of his lost love, Sarah. Having discovered where she is, Coalhouse embarks on a plan to win back her affections (“Gettin' Ready Rag”), culminating in a visit to Henry Ford's factory for a brand new Model T, and the inventor himself proudly explains his system of automated production (“Henry Ford”).Back in New Rochelle, Mother and Edgar wait for the trolley to New York City and meet Tateh and the Little Girl, who are heading to Boston. To set an example for her son, who is staring rudely at them, Mother surprises Tateh by engaging him in polite conversation (“Nothing Like the City”). On his way to find Sarah in New Rochelle, Coalhouse encounters a volunteer fire squad, led by chief Will Conklin, who react with hostility to the sight of a black man driving his own car.  Meanwhile, Sarah sings to her son in the attic of their new home (“Your Daddy's Son”), attempting to explain how her heartbreak, fear and despair led her to make such a terrible decision.Coalhouse arrives at the Family's door on his quest to find and win back Sarah. He is stunned to learn of her child's existence and when she refuses to see him, he resolves to return the following Sunday. This continues for some time (“The Courtship”), and eventually Mother invites him inside for a refreshment. He tells her of his career as a musician and his plans to support his family. Father returns home from the North Pole to find Coalhouse playing ragtime in the Family's parlor. He is stunned by the unexpected and unorthodox changes to his household, and he finds Mother unsympathetic to his complaints. He reflects on how much he has missed and how unsure he is of the world, but Mother and Younger Brother have embraced the changes. Hearing Coalhouse's music, Sarah finally descends to forgive him, and the lovers are joyfully reunited (“New Music”).Coalhouse takes Sarah on an idyllic picnic, where he tells her of his hopes for the future, inspired by the words of Booker T. Washington. With their son in their arms, the pair sing about the promise this country offers their baby boy (“Wheels of a Dream”).Emma Goldman speaks passionately in a Worker's Hall, promoting the textile mills strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts, where mill workers, including Tateh and his daughter, are suffering at the hands of the national militia called in to settle the strike.  Younger Brother takes respite from the cold inside the rally and finds inspiration, imagining Goldman is speaking directly to him (“The Night That Goldman Spoke at Union Square”).  The rally descends into a riot as Goldman is arrested, which mirrors the chaos in Lawrence. Tateh, participating in the strike, is attempting to evacuate his daughter to safety, but he is struck by a policeman and they are separated. At the last moment he leaps on the train to accompany her out of Lawrence. As she sobs, terrified at the violence, Tateh calms her by showing her his newest invention: a flip book of moving silhouettes. The conductor of the train they are on offers to buy the book and Tateh, hurriedly dubbing it a ""moviebook"", sells it to him for a dollar. Recognizing that he has a product people will buy, Tateh celebrates his first chance at real success and resolves never to look back (“Gliding”).Returning home from their picnic, Coalhouse and Sarah are stopped by Will Conklin and his volunteer fire squad.  Conklin demands a toll be paid in exchange for passage but Coalhouse will not yield to the injustice. As Booker T. Washington gives a lecture advocating patience and dignity in the black community, the firemen destroy the Model T and roll it into a lake (“The Trashing of the Car”).  Incensed, Coalhouse seeks justice but the system has none to offer (“Justice”). Furious and determined to keep his dignity, Coalhouse postpones his marriage to Sarah until his car is restored, which prompts her to seek justice on his behalf.  She hears of a campaign rally in New Rochelle and goes in the hopes that the vice-presidential candidate will be able to help (“President”).  However, she is mistaken for a would-be assassin by JP Morgan and beaten to death by the Secret Service.  At her funeral, grief and anger overtake her mourners, who alternatively demand an end to such injustice and pray for the day when all people will have justice and equality. As Mother, Father, Tateh and Emma Goldman look on, Coalhouse collapses by Sarah's grave (“Till We Reach That Day”).Act TwoIn a dream sequence, The Little Boy watches Harry Houdini perform a daring escape act in which he is locked in a dynamite-laden box by Will Conklin. The box explodes, and although Houdini emerges smiling from the audience, the little boy wakes up screaming from his nightmare (""Harry Houdini, Master Escapist"").  He yells for his mother, proclaiming that something bad is going to happen. He is proved correct when a volunteer firehouse is bombed and several firemen are killed.After Sarah's death, Coalhouse vows to get justice on his own terms (“Coalhouse's Soliloquy”).  He terrorizes New Rochelle, killing several firemen and bombing a volunteer firehouse while posting demands that his car be restored and returned to him, and that Will Conklin be delivered into his hands. Booker T. Washington condemns Coalhouse's actions but many angry young men are drawn to his cause (“Coalhouse Demands”). The family stands at the center of the scandal as Mother retains custody of Sarah and Coalhouse's baby. Father blames her for bringing this turmoil into their lives, but Younger Brother furiously lambasts him for his blindness. He storms out of the house.  Mother is becoming increasingly irritated by Father's actions, and encourages him to explain to their son what is happening. Instead, Father invites Edgar to a baseball game, an act that earns him his wife's open scorn. He expects it to be the genteel, respectful game he played in college, and is horrified to find himself in the middle of a rowdy crowd of immigrants and drunks (“What a Game”).Father's attempt at distraction is not enough to keep at bay the effects of Coalhouse's demands and acts of violence (“Fire in the City”). As the outside world bears down on the family, Father decides to move them all to Atlantic City where there is the promise of an escape from the worries of New York (“Atlantic City”).  Upon their arrival, the family encounter a film crew taking shots of the boardwalk, directed by none other than Tateh, who has re-invented himself as ""the Baron Ashkenazy"", a pioneering director and producer of moving pictures (“Buffalo Nickel Photoplay, Inc.”). Also present in Atlantic City are Evelyn Nesbit, whose career is now in a downward spiral, and Harry Houdini, who is recovering from the loss of his beloved mother by delving into the supernatural. When he encounters Edgar on the street, the young boy urges Houdini to ""warn the Duke"" before running off.   Edgar and the Little Girl soon become fast friends, prompting the growth of a friendship between Mother and Tateh.  Together they marvel in how simple and profound children's lives are, and he confesses to her his humble origins, an act of trust that touches her greatly (“Our Children”).Back in Harlem, Younger Brother seeks out Coalhouse but is repeatedly turned away until Coalhouse is convinced that he can be trusted.  As one of Coalhouse's men leads Younger Brother to the Gang's hideout, Coalhouse, who has banished music from his life, watches a carefree young couple (""Harlem Nightclub"") and remembers his first encounter with Sarah (“Sarah Brown Eyes”). Once Younger Brother arrives, he is unable to articulate why he wants to join the fight. The men's profound thoughts are narrated by Emma Goldman, but instead he merely tells Coalhouse ""I know how to blow things up."" (“He Wanted to Say”).Coalhouse and his men, including Younger Brother, take over J.P. Morgan's magnificent library in the heart of New York City and threaten to blow it up. Father informs Mother that he's been summoned to New York to help reason with Coalhouse. Before he goes, he assures her that everything will soon return to the way it was, but Mother has changed too much to allow that to happen (“Back to Before”).  Upon his arrival at the tense police encampment around the library, Father suggests that Coalhouse may listen to Booker T. Washington. Coalhouse allows Washington to enter the library but remains unreachable until Washington mentions the legacy Coalhouse is leaving his son.  Coalhouse and Washington work out a deal for peaceful surrender but Younger Brother is enraged by Coalhouse's abandonment of their cause (“Look What You've Done”).Washington leaves and Father enters the library as a hostage. The change in his life that he has been so forcefully trying to ignore finally manages to squeeze into his heart as Coalhouse convinces Younger Brother and his men that violence will not solve injustice.  Coalhouse charges them all to change society through the power of their words and by telling their children their story (“Make Them Hear You”).  Profoundly affected by their leader's sacrifice, Younger Brother and the Gang leave the Morgan Library peacefully while Father tells Coalhouse about his son.  Coalhouse thanks Father for his kindness and, as he leaves the library, is shot and killed by the police.Edgar takes on the task of fulfilling Coalhouse's wishes that their story be told.

Father is killed when the RMS Lusitania is sunk, and after a year of mourning, Mother marries Tateh. They adopt Coalhouse and Sarah's son, naming him Coalhouse Walker III, and move to California. Watching his children play, Tateh is struck by an idea for a film series centering on a group of children of different races and classes banding together. The Era of Ragtime may be over, but as the united family is watched by the spirits of Coalhouse and Sarah, America continues to assimilate and flourish (“Epilogue: Ragtime/Wheels of a Dream: Reprise”).","This staging takes place in New York.

She manages to make friends with a girl named Martha, who are bullied also, because of her excess weight. After attempt to protect Martha, it gets worse for Veronica: the girl is given the nickname ""Marta – dump truck"".

Veronica agrees. Everything runs without a hitch. Forest, guys standing in front of her naked and grinning. A shot rang out and Ram falls.

He rejoices and says aloud a brilliant plan: he would make the whole school to sign a petition for the arrival of a rock band, to be able to forge their handwriting, and then the whole school would have committed suicide on the same day, from a bomb in the basement. He thought this plan was genius.  After Jason leaves, it appears that Sawyer lied to him and hanging was faked. Now she just had to stop a mad guy, not allowing him to kill so many people.

Peter is thrilled when his shadow is re-attached (""I've Gotta Crow"") and tells her that he lives in Neverland (""Never Never Land"") with the Lost Boys. Wendy wakes her brothers up, and Peter invites them all to Neverland, and promises to teach them to fly. Peter happily launches himself into the air (""I'm Flying"").Peter sprinkles the children with fairy dust and tells them to ""think lovely thoughts"" (""I'm Flying – Reprise""). The children follow Peter, but Michael goes back when maid Liza comes into the room, giving her some of his fairy dust and inviting her to come to Neverland with them. Act II Never LandPeter's ""Lost Boys"" are standing outside their underground lair, wondering when he will return, when they hear Captain Hook and his pirates (""Pirate Song""). The boys hide. Hook tells Smee, his right-hand man, that he wants to kill Peter, because he cut off his hand and threw it to a crocodile, which has since then developed a taste for Hook and follows him around. Luckily for Hook, the crocodile has swallowed a clock that ticks and alerts Hook to its presence. Hook accidentally stumbles upon the entrance to the hideout, and summons Smee and his men to provide background music while he plans the Boys' demise (""Hook's Tango""), a rich cake with poisonous icing. Hook suddenly hears a loud tick-tock; the crocodile appears but Hook escapes. The pirates flee, and the Boys reappear, thinking they are safe. Suddenly, a group of ""Indians"" appears, led by Tiger Lily (""Indians""). They leave the Boys alone, and go on hunting the pirates.The Lost Boys suddenly spot Wendy in the sky and taking her for a bird, one of them shoots an arrow. Peter, Michael and John land to find the arrow lodged in her heart, although she isn't dead. The Lost Boys build a house around her, hoping that she will become their mother (""Wendy""), to which, when she wakes up, she agrees. Hook plants the cake, but Wendy doesn't let the children eat it as she knows it wouldn't be good for them; instead, she tells the Boys stories. Hook is infuriated that the Boys have found a mother. He plots to kidnap Wendy and the Boys, while Smee and the pirates play a ""Tarantella"". After the pirates leave for their ship, Liza arrives and dances with the animals of Neverland while Peter keeps watch outside the house.A few days pass with everyone having adventures. One day in the forest, after Peter leads the Boys in their anthem (""I Won't Grow Up""), they almost run into the pirates, who have captured Tiger Lily and tie her to a tree. Peter hides and mimics Hook's voice, ordering the men to release her. When Hook arrives, he is enraged and demands that the ""spirit of the forest"" speak to him. Peter tricks them all into thinking he is Hook, and that the real Hook is a codfish. Hook asks the ""spirit"" to reveal its true identity. Peter obliges, pretending to be a ""beautiful lady"" (""Oh, My Mysterious Lady"") and Hook and his pirates try to ambush Peter, but they are chased away by Tiger Lily and her tribe of Native Americans.Back at the hideout, Tiger Lily and her tribe are almost shot by the Boys, until Peter reveals the truce between them. They smoke a peace pipe and vow eternal friendship (""Ugg-a-Wugg""). Tiger Lily and her Indians leave to stand guard around the house above. Wendy asks Peter to sing the Boys a lullaby (""Distant Melody""). Michael and John want to return home, and Wendy admits to being homesick, too. The Boys wish they had parents, and Wendy offers hers to all of them. Everyone is excited about being adopted, except Peter, who says he will not go because he knows he will grow up if he does. Wendy tells him she will come back once a year to do his spring cleaning.The pirates attack and subdue the Indians. They give Peter a fake all-clear signal, so Peter sadly sends Wendy, her brothers, and the Lost Boys on their way. Before she leaves, Wendy sets out Peter's ""medicine"" for him to take before bed. After she tearfully leaves, Peter, who pretended not to care, throws himself on a bed and cries himself to sleep.  As they leave the underground house, Wendy and the boys are captured by the pirates. Hook then sneaks into the lair and poisons Peter's medicine. Tinker Bell awakens Peter, tells him of the ambush, and warns him about the poison, but he waves her off as he prepares for a rescue. Desperate, she drinks the poison herself. Dying, she tells Peter that if every boy and girl who believes in fairies would clap their hands, she would live. Peter asks the audience to believe and clap their hands. They do, and Tinker Bell is saved. Peter grabs his sword and heads off to rescue Wendy and the Boys. Act III The Jolly RogerHook revels in his success (""Hook's Waltz""). As the plank is prepared, Hook hears the tick-tock of the crocodile and panics. It is actually Peter with a clock, and while Hook cowers Peter and the Boys help the Indians, the animals and Liza onto the ship and hide. Peter hides in a closet and kills two pirates Hook sends in. A third pirate, Starkey, refuses to obey Hook's order to go in and jumps overboard. The pirates then carry the Boys in, and the Boys pretend to be afraid as they are carried in. Peter disguises himself as a pirate, and the pirates think the ""doodle-doo"" (named so because Peter still crows after killing the pirates) killed all the Boys. Hook believes the ship is now cursed, and everyone thinks Wendy is the source. The pirates push Wendy to the plank. Peter ditches his disguise and the Indians and animals attack, as well as the Boys who are alive and armed. The pirates are all defeated, and Peter challenges Hook to a duel and defeats him. Hook threatens to blow up the ship with a bomb, but runs into the real crocodile (whom Peter also brought on the ship). Peter catches the dropped bomb and tosses it in the sea after Hook slides down the plank (which is shaped like a slide) with the crocodile chasing behind him. As Peter puts his fingers in his ears, the bomb explodes and Hook is either blown to smithereens or is eaten by the crocodile. Everyone sings Peter's praises (""I've Gotta Crow"" [reprise]). Before the Darling children and the Lost Boys go to London, Liza asks Peter to teach her to crow (""I Gotta Crow"" [2nd reprise]).Back home, the Darlings sit by the nursery window night after night, hoping for the return of their children. The children silently reappear and sing to their mother (""Tender Shepherd"" [reprise]). The Darlings happily agree to adopt the Lost Boys (""We Will Grow Up""). Wendy promises to wait for Peter, hoping that one day he will return for her.Years pass, and Peter returns to the nursery, surprising a much older Wendy, who no longer expected him. He has come to take her to Neverland for Spring cleaning, but she declines as she is now grown up; married with a daughter of her own, Jane. Peter starts to cry, and Wendy leaves the room at the sound of her husband's offstage voice. Jane awakes and, like her mother before her, asks, ""Boy, why are you crying?"" Peter introduces himself, but Jane knows all about him from her mother's stories. She has been waiting for him to come take her to Neverland and to learn to fly. Peter, now happy again, throws fairy dust on her, but as they are about to leave, Wendy tries to stop them, saying, ""Oh, if only I could go with you!"" In the most poignant moment of the show, Peter answers with a sad but understanding smile, ""You can't. You see, Wendy ... you're too grown up"". And so Wendy reluctantly lets Jane go, ""just for Spring cleaning."" Her daughter and the ""boy who wouldn't grow up"" fly off into the night as Wendy watches from the window. (""Finale: Never Never Land [Reprise]"")","When a family of Darlings came to rest not in their home, Nana the dog was left in the street. It usually protected kids. Even very strange discovery inside kids’ bedroom – an apparition of some boy – did not change the decision to take a rest. Parents have left the building & their children fell in the hugs of Morpheus. In the place flied-in a fairy Tinker Bell & Peter Pan. They began to search for the lost shadow. Finding that he cannot attach a shadow to the body, Peter was very upset. Crying of Pan woke Wendy. The girl helped the boy sewing his shadow to shoes. Seeing now that he's all right, Peter told her about the country of Neverland, where the lost boy lived. When a girl woke up the brothers, an unusual guest offered to children to go with him & they gladly agreed. Sprinkling them with magic dust, Peter taught Wendy, John & Michael how to fly. They soon hit the road.  As long as the lost boys were expecting the return of their commander, Captain Hook had found the entrance to their secret hideout. Pirate hated Peter because he cut off his hand, then gave it to a crocodile. Since then, Captain hunted Peter. Due to the ticking of the clock that reptile swallowed, pirate recognized the approaching danger. Finding shelter of children, Hook decided to cook for them a poisoned cake, but he was scared by the sound of the clock. Seeing in the sky a spot, one of the boys shot it. He hit into a flying Wendy. To the fallen girl had descended Peter, John & Michael. A small house was build around her. When she came into consciousness, Wendy agreed to become a mother to the lost boys. She would not let the children eat a poisonous cake that has been prepared for them by pirates. Angered Hook decided to kidnap the girl.  When Peter freed from captivity Tiger the Indian, he established peace between the Indians & lost boys. Deciding to return home, kids offered their new friends to go with them. Only Peter refused the invitation. Wendy had promised to fly to him once a year in the spring to make a big cleaning. Pirates defeated the Indians & captured the departing children. In frustration, Peter didn’t see as Captain poured poison into medicine of Wendy. Fairy had warned him that the children were in trouble. She drank the poison herself & thus protected the boy. Fairy was eventually rescued by children around the world who have been clapping in hands in a sign that they believe in fairies. Going to the aid of friends, Peter took a sword & a clock.  When Captain heard the ticking, he decided that a crocodile made his way to the ship. Peter freed Indians & children. Dressed as a pirate, he pretended that he had killed all the lost boys. Captain believed him. The crew felt that Wendy brought misfortune to their ship & decided to drown her. Peter, Indians & lost boys rescued the girl. Captain fell over the side of the ship, where he was expected by a crocodile. Peter also threw there a bomb with which Captain wanted to explode the pirate ship. Children returned home from Neverland. When Peter again saw Wendy, she was already grown up woman. He took with him to Neverland her daughter, who knew him from mother's stories."
South Pacific,"  Act I On a South Pacific island during World War II, two half-Polynesian children, Ngana and Jerome, happily sing as they play together (""Dites-Moi""). Ensign Nellie Forbush, a naïve U.S. Navy nurse from Little Rock, Arkansas, has fallen in love with Emile de Becque, a middle-aged French plantation owner, though she has known him only briefly. Even though everyone else is worried about the outcome of the war, Nellie tells Emile that she is sure everything will turn out all right (""A Cockeyed Optimist""). Emile also loves Nellie, and each wonders if the other reciprocates those feelings (""Twin Soliloquies""). Emile expresses his love for Nellie, recalling how they met at the officers' club dance and instantly were attracted to each other (""Some Enchanted Evening"").  Nellie, promising to think about their relationship, returns to the hospital. Emile calls Ngana and Jerome to him, revealing to the audience that they are his children, unbeknownst to Nellie.Meanwhile, the restless American Seabees, led by crafty Luther Billis, lament the absence of available women – Navy nurses are commissioned officers and off-limits to enlisted men. There is one civilian woman on the island, nicknamed ""Bloody Mary"", a sassy middle-aged Tonkinese vendor of grass skirts, who engages the sailors in sarcastic, flirtatious banter as she tries to sell them her wares (""Bloody Mary""). Billis yearns to visit the nearby island of Bali Ha'i – which is off-limits to all but officers – supposedly to witness a Boar's Tooth Ceremony (at which he can get an unusual native artifact); the other sailors josh him, saying that his real motivation is to see the young French women there. Billis and the sailors further lament their lack of feminine companionship (""There Is Nothing Like a Dame"").U.S. Marine Lieutenant Cable arrives on the island from Guadalcanal, having been sent to take part in a dangerous spy mission whose success could turn the tide of the war against Japan.  Bloody Mary tries to persuade Cable to visit ""Bali Ha'i"", mysteriously telling him that it is his special island. Billis, seeing an opportunity, urges Cable to go.  Cable meets with his commanding officers, Captain George Brackett and Commander William Harbison, who plan to ask Emile to help with the mission because he used to live on the island where the mission will take place. They ask Nellie to help them find out more about Emile's background, for example, his politics and why he left France. They have heard, for instance, that Emile committed a murder, and this might make him less than desirable for such a mission.After thinking a bit more about Emile and deciding she has become attracted on the basis of little knowledge of him, Nellie tells the other nurses that she intends to end her relationship with him (""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair""). But when he arrives unexpectedly and invites Nellie to a party where he will introduce her to his friends, she accepts. Emile declares his love for Nellie and asks her to marry him. When she mentions politics, he speaks of universal freedom, and describes fleeing France after standing up against a bully, who died accidentally as the two fought. After hearing this, Nellie agrees to marry Emile. After he exits, Nellie joyously gives voice to her feelings (""I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy"").Cable's mission is to land on a Japanese-held island and report on Japanese ship movements. The Navy officers ask Emile to be Cable's guide, but he refuses their request because of his hopes for a new life with Nellie. Commander Harbison, the executive officer, tells Cable to go on leave until the mission can take place, and Billis obtains a boat and takes Cable to Bali Ha'i. There, Billis participates in the native ceremony, while Bloody Mary introduces Cable to her beautiful daughter, Liat, with whom he must communicate haltingly in French.  Believing that Liat's only chance at a better life is to marry an American officer, Mary leaves Liat alone with Cable. The two are instantly attracted to each other and make love (""Younger Than Springtime"").  Billis and the rest of the crew are ready to leave the island, yet must wait for Cable who, unbeknownst to them, is with Liat (""Bali Ha'i"" (reprise)). Bloody Mary proudly tells Billis that Cable is going to be her son-in-law.Meanwhile, after Emile's party, Nellie and he reflect on how happy they are to be in love (Reprises of ""I'm in Love with a Wonderful Guy"", ""Twin Soliloquies"", ""Cockeyed Optimist"" and ""I'm Gonna Wash That Man Right Outa My Hair"").  Emile introduces Nellie to Jerome and Ngana.  Though she finds them charming, she is shocked when Emile reveals that they are his children by his first wife, a dark-skinned Polynesian woman, now deceased.  Nellie is unable to overcome her deep-seated racial prejudices and tearfully leaves Emile, after which he reflects sadly on what might have been (""Some Enchanted Evening"" (reprise)). Act II It is Thanksgiving Day. The GIs and nurses dance in a holiday revue titled ""Thanksgiving Follies"". In the past week, an epidemic of malaria has hit the island of Bali Ha'i. Having visited Bali Ha'i often to be with Liat, Cable is also ill, but escapes from the hospital to be with Liat.  As Liat and Cable spend more time together, Bloody Mary is delighted. She encourages them to continue their carefree life on the island (""Happy Talk"") and urges them to marry. Cable, aware of his family's prejudices, says he cannot marry a Tonkinese girl. Bloody Mary furiously drags her distraught daughter away, telling Cable that Liat must now marry a much older French plantation owner instead. Cable laments his loss. (""Younger Than Springtime"" (reprise)).For the final number of the Thanksgiving Follies, Nellie performs a comedy burlesque dressed as a sailor singing the praises of ""his"" sweetheart (""Honey Bun""). Billis plays Honey Bun, dressed in a blond wig, grass skirt and coconut-shell bra. After the show, Emile asks Nellie to reconsider. She insists that she cannot feel the same way about him since she knows about his children's Polynesian mother.  Frustrated and uncomprehending, Emile asks Cable why he and Nellie have such prejudices. Cable, filled with self-loathing, replies that ""it's not something you're born with"", yet it is an ingrained part of their upbringing (""You've Got to Be Carefully Taught""). He also vows that if he gets out of the war alive, he won't go home to the United States; everything he wants is on these islands. Emile imagines what might have been (""This Nearly Was Mine""). Dejected and feeling that he has nothing to lose, he agrees to join Cable on his dangerous mission.The mission begins with plenty of air support. Offstage, Billis stows away on the plane, falls out when the plane is hit by anti-aircraft fire, and ends up in the ocean waiting to be rescued; the massive rescue operation inadvertently becomes a diversion that allows Emile and Cable to land on the other side of the island undetected. The two send back reports on Japanese ships' movements in the ""Slot"", a strategic strait; American aircraft intercept and destroy the Japanese ships. When the Japanese Zeros strafe the Americans' position, Emile narrowly escapes, but Cable is killed.Nellie learns of Cable's death and that Emile is missing. She realizes that she was foolish to reject Emile because of the race of his children's mother. Bloody Mary and Liat come to Nellie asking where Cable is; Mary explains that Liat refuses to marry anyone but him. Nellie comforts Liat. Cable and Emile's espionage work has made it possible for a major offensive, Operation Alligator, to begin. The previously idle fighting men, including Billis, go off to battle.Nellie spends time with Jerome and Ngana and soon comes to love them. While the children are teaching her to sing ""Dites-Moi,"" suddenly Emile's voice joins them. Emile has returned to discover that Nellie has overcome her prejudices and has fallen in love with his children. Emile, Nellie and the children rejoice (""Dites-Moi"" (reprise)).","On one islet located in the South Pacific, two kidz were on the terrace of the mansion. Their procreator, a wealthy planter Emile, admired greatly US Navy nurse Nellie. Full of life & optimism girl was subdued to enigmatic Frenchman – his romantic & passionate emotions won her heart. On the same islet was a group of restless sailors & marines. Young people suffered greatly because they lacked the attention of a female kind. Between Luther, who monopolized trade due to souvenir tax & Bloody Mary, a local supplier, there was a real war for the buyers. Young marine Lieutenant Cable arrived at the base in order to carry out a secret mission. He needed to get to a nearby islet & obtain information on Japanese ships. Lieutenant decided to involve in this task a person who knew the surrounding countryside. Cable asked plantation owner to accompany him.  At this time in search of female companionship, Luther decided to get on the mysterious islet Bali. The man tried to influence the young lieutenant & send him there. Cable has agreed to visit the islet with the expedition. Arriving at Bali, he was introduced to a daughter of Bloody Mary & fell in love with her. Nurse reflected on her attitude to Emile. A girl tried to be persistent, but after learning that the Frenchman loves her, she immediately replied with reciprocity. Soon planter introduced Nellie with two his children, born by a Polynesian girl. While the girl liked the kids, she was unable to overcome own provincial prejudices & ceased to meet with Emile. Nurse plunged into work with head – she was preparing a show for Thanksgiving Day.  Behind the scenes Bloody Mary & Liat came to Cable. Despite their entreaties to marry the girl, the lieutenant did not let his feelings go – he also was pinned down by prejudices. Watching this, a Frenchman was amazed that Americans voluntarily renounce love just for nothing. Soon Emile & Cable, suffering because of broken hearts, went on a secret mission. They managed to broadcast the necessary information, after which they were discovered by the Japanese. The lieutenant was killed & the connection with the Frenchman has been lost. Realizing that she could lose her love forever, Nellie began to reproach herself for the stupid prejudices & that she had not given her answer to the feelings of the plantation owner. The girl came to the house of a Frenchman & began to take care of his children. Soon they were joined by Emile – wounded & tired, but alive. Planter was happy that the beloved returned to him, abandoning her racial prejudices."
Spamalot,"  Before the show A recording encourages members of the audience to ""let your cellphones and pagers ring willy-nilly,"" and comments that they should ""be aware there are heavily armed knights on stage that may drag you on stage and impale you."" This was recorded by Eric Idle. Act I A historian narrates a brief overview of medieval England. In a miscommunication between the actors and the narrator, the actors sing an introductory song about Finland (""Fisch Schlapping Song""). The Historian returns, irritated, and tells the frolicking Finns that he was talking about England, not Finland.  The scene immediately changes to a dreary, dark village with penitent monks in hooded robes chanting Latin and hitting themselves with books. King Arthur travels the land with his servant Patsy, who follows him around banging two coconut shells together to make the sound of a horse's hooves as Arthur ""rides"" before him, trying to recruit Knights of the Round Table to join him in Camelot. He encounters a pair of sentries who are more interested in debating whether two swallows could successfully carry a coconut than in listening to the king.Sir Robin, a collector of plague victims, and Lancelot, a large, handsome and incredibly violent man, meet as Lancelot attempts to dispose of the sickly Not Dead Fred. Although a plague victim, the man insists that he is not dead yet and he can dance and sing. He completes a dance number, but is soon hit over the head with a shovel and killed by an impatient Lancelot. (""He Is Not Dead Yet""). They agree to become Knights of the Round Table together, Lancelot for the fighting, and Robin for the singing and the dancing.Arthur attempts to convince a peasant named Dennis Galahad that he, Arthur, is King of England because the Lady of the Lake gave him Excalibur, the sword given only to the man fit to rule England. However, Dennis and his mother, Mrs Galahad, are political radicals and deny that any king who has not been elected by the people has any legitimate right to rule over them. To settle the issue, Arthur has the Lady Of The Lake and her Laker Girls appear to turn Dennis into a knight (""Come With Me""). Cheered on by the girls (""Laker Girls Cheer""), the Lady Of The Lake turns Dennis into Sir Galahad and together, they sing a generic Broadway love song (""The Song That Goes Like This""), complete with chandelier.  They are joined by Sir Robin and Sir Lancelot, and together with Sir Bedevere and ""the aptly named"" Sir Not-Appearing-In-This-Show (a knight resembling Don Quixote, who promptly apologises and leaves), they make up the Knights of the Round Table (""All For One"").The five knights gather in Camelot, a deliberately anachronistic place resembling Las Vegas's Camelot-inspired Excalibur resort, complete with showgirls, oversized dice and the Lady of the Lake headlining the Castle in full Liza Minnelli get-up (""Knights Of The Round Table""/""The Song That Goes Like This (Reprise)""). In the midst of their revelry, they are contacted by God (a recording voiced by John Cleese of the original Monty Python troupe and Eric Idle in the version currently touring the UK) who tells them to locate the Holy Grail. Urged on by the Lady Of The Lake (""Find Your Grail""), the Knights set off. They travel throughout the land until they reach a castle, only to be viciously taunted by lewd French soldiers. They attempt to retaliate by sending them a large wooden rabbit in the style of the Trojan Horse; however, they realise after the fact that it was not as simple as leaving the rabbit and walking away – they should have hidden inside it.  Defeated, they leave in a hurry when the French begin taunting them again, sending cancan dancers after them and throwing barnyard animals including cows at them (""Run Away!""). Arthur and his followers manage to run into the safety of the wings before the French catapult the Trojan Rabbit at them. Act II Sir Robin and his minstrels follow King Arthur and Patsy into a ""dark and very expensive forest"" (Arthur later says they're in a ""Dark and extremely expensive forest), where they are separated. King Arthur meets the terrifying but silly Knights who say Ni, who demand a shrubbery. King Arthur despairs of finding one, but Patsy cheers him up (""Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life"") and they find a shrubbery shortly after.Sir Robin, after wandering the forest for some time with his minstrels (""Brave Sir Robin""), encounters The Black Knight, who scares him off, but King Arthur, who happens on the scene, more or less defeats him by cutting off both his arms and legs, impaling his still-alive torso on a door, and leaving to give the Knights their shrubbery. The Knights accept it, but next demand that King Arthur put on a musical and bring it to Broadway (in the United Kingdom, this became a West End musical; on the tour, they must put on a ""Broadway musical""), implying that it need only be Broadway-style, ""but not an Andrew Lloyd Webber"". The mere mention of his name causes everyone to cover their ears and scream in pain. Sir Robin, who has found Arthur by this point,  insists that it would be impossible for them to accomplish this next task, since you need Jews for a successful Broadway (or West End) musical (""You Won't Succeed On Broadway""), and proves his point in a wild production number filled with  Fiddler on the Roof parodies, including a bottle dance with Grails instead of bottles. King Arthur and Patsy promptly set off in search of Jews.(In countries that don't have a tradition of Jews in the theatre, the lyrics of ""You Won't Succeed on Broadway"" are sometimes changed to instead describe the high production standards and acting talent needed to stage a successful musical in that country.  For example, in the South Korean version, Sir Robin sings about recent successful musicals that were staged in Seoul during the previous decade.  Meanwhile, members of the ensemble appear onstage dressed as various characters from those musicals.  Among these characters are a cat from Cats, Kenickie from Grease, Kim from Miss Saigon, The Phantom from The Phantom of the Opera, and Velma Kelly from Chicago.  As with the original version of the song, Sir Robin and the entire ensemble end the number with a song and dance routine.)While the Lady Of The Lake laments her lack of stage time (""Whatever Happened To My Part?""), Sir Lancelot receives a letter from what he assumes is a young damsel in distress. He is very surprised to find that the ""damsel"" is actually an effeminate young man named Prince Herbert (""Where Are You?""/""Here Are You"") whose overbearing, music-hating father, the King of Swamp Castle, is forcing him into an arranged marriage. As Herbert is asking Lancelot to help him escape, the King of Swamp Castle cuts the rope that he is using to climb out of the window, and Herbert falls to his apparent death. Lancelot is a bit puzzled at the king's actions, but it is revealed that Herbert was saved at the last minute by Lancelot's sidekick, Concorde. The King asks his son how he was saved, exactly, to which Herbert replies happily with a song. But the king charges at his son with a spear, preparing to kill him. Lancelot steps in to save him, then gives a tearful, heartfelt speech about sensitivity to the king on Herbert's behalf, and Lancelot is outed as a homosexual in the process, an announcement celebrated in a wild disco number (""His Name is Lancelot"").King Arthur begins to give up hope of ever putting on the Broadway musical and laments that he is alone, even though Patsy has been with him the entire time (""I'm All Alone""). The Lady Of The Lake appears and tells Arthur that he and the Knights have been in a Broadway musical all along (in some productions she also points out Patsy's presence, to which Arthur claims that he sees Patsy as ""family"" and thus doesn't always consider him a separate person). Patsy also reveals he is half Jewish, but didn't want to say anything to Arthur because ""that's not really the sort of thing you say to a heavily armed Christian."" All that's left is for King Arthur to find the Grail and marry someone. After picking up on some not-too-subtle hints, Arthur decides to marry the Lady Of The Lake after he finds the Grail (""Twice in Every Show"").Reunited with his Knights, Arthur meets Tim the Enchanter who warns them of the danger of a killer rabbit. When the rabbit bites a knight's head off, Arthur uses the Holy Hand Grenade of Antioch against it, knocking down a nearby hill and revealing that the ""evil rabbit"" was actually a puppet controlled by a surprised puppeteer. A large stone block showing a combination of letters and numbers is also revealed. (The letters are based on the seat numbering system used by each theatre.  They are changed from performance to performance to discourage audience members from intentionally booking any of the possible seats.  The seat is typically on the aisle in one of the first few rows nearest the orchestra. In the Broadway production and on the tour it is either A101, B101, C101 or D101; i.e., Seat 101 – which is house right of the center aisle – of Rows A, B, C, or D.  In the West End Production a word is revealed – DONE, CONE or BONE, referring to D1, C1 and B1 respectively.) After pondering the final clue, Arthur admits that they're ""a bit stumped with the clue thing"" and asks God to ""give them a hand"". A large hand points to the audience and Arthur realises that the letters and numbers refer to a seat number in the audience. The grail is ""found"" (with some sleight of hand) under the seat and the person sitting in the seat is rewarded with a small trophy and a polaroid photo. (""The Holy Grail""). Arthur marries the Lady of the Lake, who reveals that her name is Guinevere; Lancelot marries Herbert (who finally has a chance to sing); and Sir Robin decides to pursue a career in musical theatre. Herbert's father attempts to interrupt the finale and stop all of the ""bloody singing"", but is hit over the head with a shovel by Lancelot, a nod to ""He is Not Yet Dead"".  (""Act 2 Finale/Always Look on the Bright Side of Life (Company Bow)"").The overall duration of the show is about two hours plus interval time.","This action starts in some dark English village during the medieval times. We see a local ruler travelling alongside to his butler. Their goal is to enlist more chevaliers to protect Camelot. The king also has two sentries with him. Two travelers enroll on the royal service – the first will be a fighter & the second will be a singer. A main character tries to convince plain people that the real leader of the country is he, as the pulled-out-of-stone-sword has been given to him. But they refuse to believe in it, because they are radicals considering that any head of the state must be elected. With the help, another peasant is turned into knight. Now the ruler has enlisted 5 persons and they all turn back to Camelot.  The kingdom is in anarchy. Seeing this, the Christian Deity asks them to find a Holy Grail. During their journey, they get derided by Frenchmen. They are able to run away from them. The heroes go through the forest, where they get separated. The first part of the group meets an even knight, but the king helps him by defeating the villain. Several stupid knights appear on the way. They ask to create a musical of Broadway style. The ruler starts searching for a Jews to fulfill this task. One of the chevaliers receives a hand-written letter from a lady, who then turns to be a young prince. He saves him from the arranged marriage & cruel father. Trying to protect the young guy, the knight is called a gay. The king is upset, as he cannot make an appropriate show. But the Lady of the Lake appears to tell him that they have been in a spectacle during all this time. It is discovered that the servant is half-Jewish. All that the king must do now is to marry. The whole group finally is reunited. They meet an evil rabbit, who is said to be extremely dangerous. In fact, it turns to be a puppet. They see a stone with a combination. Unable to find a clue, the main characters ask God to help. The group understands that the numbers refer to the seat in the hall. They finally find a grail. In the end there are two marriages – the king marries the Lady of the Lake, while the knight marries a young prince."
Company," In the early 1990s, Furth and Sondheim revised the libretto, cutting and altering dialogue that had become dated and rewriting the end to act one. This synopsis is based on the revised libretto. Act I Robert is a well-liked single man living in New York City, whose friends are all married or engaged couples: Joanne and Larry, Peter and Susan, Harry and Sarah, David and Jenny, and Paul and Amy. It is Robert's 35th birthday and the couples have gathered to throw him a surprise party. When Robert fails to blow out any candles on his birthday cake, the couples promise him that his birthday wish will still come true, though he has wished for nothing, since his friends are all that he needs (""Company""). What follows is a series of disconnected vignettes in no apparent chronological order, each featuring Robert during a visit with one of the couples or alone with a girlfriend.The first of these features Robert visiting Sarah, a foodie supposedly now dieting, and her husband Harry, an alcoholic supposedly now on the wagon. Sarah and Harry taunt each other on their vices, escalating toward karate-like fighting and thrashing that may or may not be playful. The caustic Joanne, the oldest, most cynical, and most-oft divorced of Robert's friends, comments sarcastically to the audience that it is ""The Little Things You Do Together"" that make a marriage work. Harry then explains, and the other married men concur, that a person is always ""Sorry-Grateful"" about getting married, and that marriage changes both everything and nothing about the way they live.Robert is next with Peter and Susan, on their apartment terrace. Peter is Ivy League, and Susan is a southern belle; the two seem to be a perfect couple, yet they surprise Robert with the news of their upcoming divorce. At the home of the uptight Jenny and chic David, Robert has brought along some marijuana that they share. The couple turns to grilling Robert on why he has not yet gotten married. Robert claims he is not against the notion, but three women he is currently fooling around with—Kathy, Marta, and April—appear and proceed, Andrews Sisters-style, to chastise Robert for his reluctance to being committed (""You Could Drive a Person Crazy""). David tries to tell Robert privately that Jenny did not like the marijuana, after she asks for another joint. ""I married a square"", he reminds his wife, demanding she bring him food.All of Robert's male friends are deeply envious about his commitment-free status, and each has found someone they find perfect for Robert (""Have I Got a Girl For You""), but Robert is waiting for someone who merges the best features of all his married female friends (""Someone is Waiting""). Robert meets his three girlfriends in a small park on three separate occasions as Marta sings of the city: crowded, dirty, uncaring, yet somehow wonderful (""Another Hundred People""). Robert first gets to know April, a slow-witted airline flight attendant. Robert then spends time with Kathy; they had dated previously and both admit that they had each secretly considered marrying the other. They laugh at this coincidence before Robert suddenly considers the idea seriously; however Kathy reveals that she is leaving for Cape Cod with a new fiancé. Finally, Robert meets with Marta; she loves New York, and babbles on about topics as diverse as true sophistication, the difference between uptown and downtown New York, and how she can always tell a New Yorker by his or her ass. Robert is left stunned.The scene turns to the day of Amy and Paul's wedding; they have lived together for years, but are only now getting married. Amy is in an overwhelming state of panic and, as the upbeat Paul harmonizes rapturously, Amy patters an impressive list of reasons why she is not ""Getting Married Today"". Robert, the best man, and Paul watch as she complains and self-destructs over every petty thing she can possibly think of and finally just calls off the wedding explicitly. Paul dejectedly storms out into the rain and Robert tries to comfort Amy, but emotionally winds up offering an impromptu proposal to her himself (""What Did I Just Do?""). His words jolt Amy back into reality, and with the parting words ""you need to marry some body, not just some body"", she runs out after Paul, at last ready to marry him. The setting returns to the scene of the birthday party, where Robert is given his cake and tries to blow out the candles again. He wishes for something this time, someone to ""Marry Me a Little"". Act II The birthday party scene is reset, and Robert goes to blow out his candles. This time, he gets them about half out, and the rest have to help him. The couples share their views on Robert with each other, comments which range from complimentary to unflattering, as Robert reflects on being the third wheel (""Side By Side By Side""), soon followed by the up-tempo paean to Robert's role as the perfect friend (""What Would We Do Without You?""). In a dance break in the middle of the number (or, in the case of the 2006 Broadway revival, in a musical solo section), each man in turn does a dance step (or, in the revival, plays a solo on his instrument), answered by his wife. Then Robert likewise does a step (or, in the case of the 2006 Broadway revival, plays two bad notes on a kazoo), but he has no partner to answer it.Robert brings April to his apartment for a nightcap after a date. She marvels ad nauseam at how homey his place is, and he casually leads her to the bed, sitting next to her on it and working on getting her into it.  She earnestly tells him of an experience from her past, involving the death of a butterfly; he counters with a bizarre remembrance of his own, obviously fabricated, and designed to put her in the mood to succumb to seduction. Meanwhile, the married women worry about Robert's single and lonesome status (as they see it), and particularly about the unsuitable qualities they find in the women he does date, asking, ""Isn't she a little bit, well--Dumb? Tacky? Vulgar? Old? Tall? Aggressive? Where is she from?...She's tall enough to be your mother...."" (""Poor Baby""). When the inevitable sex happens, we hear Robert's and April's thoughts, interspersed with music that expresses and mirrors their increasing excitement. This music often (as in the original Broadway production) accompanies a solo dance by Kathy, conveying the emotions and dynamics of making love; it has also been staged as a pas de deux, a group number, or been cut altogether in various productions (""Tick-Tock""). The next morning, April rises early, to report for duty aboard a flight to ""Barcelona"". Robert tries to get her to stay, at first wholeheartedly, parrying her apologetic protestations that she cannot, with playful begging and insistence. As April continues to reluctantly resist his entreaties, and sleepiness retakes him, Bobby seems to lose conviction, agreeing that she should go; that change apparently gets to her, and she joyfully declares that she will stay, after all.  This takes Robert by surprise, and his astonished, plaintive ""Oh, God!"" is suffused not with triumph, nor even ambivalence, but with evident fear and regret.In the following scene, Robert takes Marta to visit Peter and Susan, on their terrace. Apparently, Peter flew to Mexico to get the divorce, but he phoned Susan and she joined him there for a vacation. Bizarrely, they are still living together, claiming they have too many responsibilities to actually leave each other's lives, and that their relationship has actually been strengthened by the divorce. Susan takes Marta inside to make lunch, and Peter asks Robert if he has ever had a homosexual experience. They both admit they have, and Peter hints at the possibility that he and Robert could have such an encounter, but Robert uncomfortably laughs the conversation off as a joke just as the women return.Joanne and Larry take Robert out to a nightclub, where Larry dances, and Joanne and Robert sit watching, getting thoroughly drunk. She blames Robert for always being an outsider, only watching life rather than living it, and also persists in berating Larry. She raises her glass in a mocking toast to ""The Ladies Who Lunch"", passing judgment on various types of rich, middle-aged women wasting their lives away with mostly meaningless activities.  Her harshest criticism is reserved for those, like herself, who ""just watch"", and she concludes with the observation that all these ladies are bound together by a terror that comes with the knowledge that ""everybody dies"".  Larry returns from the dance floor, taking Joanne's drunken rant without complaint and explains to Robert that he still loves her dearly. When Larry leaves to pay the check, Joanne bluntly invites Robert to begin an affair with her, assuring him that she will ""take care of him"".  The reply this elicits from him, ""But who will I take care of?"" seems to surprise him, and to strike Joanne as a profound breakthrough on his part, ""...a door opening that's been stuck for a long time"".  Robert insists it is not, that he has studied and been open to marriages and commitment, but questions ""What do you get?"" Upon Larry's return, Robert asks again, angrily, ""What do you get?""  Joanne declares, with some satisfaction, ""I just did someone a big favor"".  She and Larry go home, leaving Robert lost in frustrated contemplation.The couples' recurrent musical motif begins yet again, with all of them focused anew on their ""Bobby Bubbi"", ""Robert darling"", ""Bobby baby"", and again inviting him to ""Drop by anytime..."". Rather than the cheery, indulgent tone he had responded with in earlier scenes, Robert suddenly, desperately, shouts ""STOP!""  In their stunned silence, he challenges them with quiet intensity: ""What do you get?"" The music to ""Being Alive"" begins, and he sings, openly enumerating the many traps and dangers he perceives in marriage; speaking their disagreements, his friends counter his ideas, one by one, encouraging him to dare to try for love and commitment. Finally, Bobby's words change, expressing a desire, increasing in urgency, for loving intimacy, even with all its problems, and the wish to meet someone with whom to face the challenge of (""Being Alive"".) The opening party resets a final time; Robert's friends have waited two hours, with still no sign of him. At last, they all prepare to leave, expressing a new hopefulness about their absent friend's chances for loving fulfillment, and wishing him a happy birthday, wherever he may be, as they leave. Robert then appears alone, smiles, and blows out his candles.","Rob lives in the Big Apple & he is a single person. He possesses friends that are married or in a relationship. Robert grows 35 years old and his fellows organize a festival for him.  Rob talks to his buddies. She & her husband Harry poignantly talk about the vices of one another. She sarcastically remarks that arguments like this is the very essence of living 2gether. Her husband says that married man is mostly guilty, but appreciative, but living as a couple changes them both.  Next, Rob speaks with another married couple. A man is a graduate of very prestigious Ivy League. A wife is a real beauty. They would seem the perfect couple, but they surprise Rob with the news of impending divorce. The third couple ask each another why he is still not married. Rob says that he is not against the idea of marriage, and now is surrounded by three women – Kate, April & March. He cannot choose among them.  As long as Rob's possesses a loner status, all men are envy. However, Rob wants to find the only girl who would be a perfection.  Rob meets his all girls. One of them reveals that leaves to another city as she has a fiancé.  The plot is confined to the day of the wedding of another couple. They lived for several years, but decided to get married only now. She panics and writes a letter, where she refuses to marry. A groom is upset, runs into the street, and Rob tries to reassure a bride. Persuasions of Rob worked & a bride tries to catch up a groom to finally marry him.  Rob invites one of his girlfriends to drink to his home after the meeting. He tries to charm her and so they spent the night together. The next morning, Rob convinced her to stay.  In the next scene, Rob & Martha visit other couple. A guy flew to Mexico to get a divorce but called his ex, and they decided to relax along. Since than, they live together and tell that the desire to divorce have had strengthened their marriage. When the girls go outside, Pete asks Rob if he had ever regretted of married. He confesses to a friend that constantly is and also constantly happy.  Rob goes in a nightclub. One of his friends advises others not to look at life but to live it. Larry joins them and tells a friend that he still loves his wife. When the husband goes to pay the bill, Joan speaks directly to Robert revealing the desire to spin an affair with him. Robert is at loss, and when the couple goes home, he remains alone in a state of shock.  At the party, Rob asks all his friends of what do they gain from marriage. He begins to sing along with Being Alive, listing all the dangers of marriage. As a result, he admits that he wants to meet the woman with whom he would have felt that he is alive. At the end of the party all the friends willing Robert happiness and depart home. He remains alone, smiles and blows out the candles."
Annie Get Your Gun," summary  Act I When the traveling Buffalo Bill's Wild West show visits Cincinnati, Ohio (""Colonel Buffalo Bill""),  Frank Butler, the show's handsome, womanizing star (""I'm a Bad, Bad, Man""), challenges anyone in town to a shooting match. Foster Wilson, a local hotel owner, doesn't appreciate the Wild West show taking over his hotel, so Frank gives him a side bet of one hundred dollars on the match. Annie Oakley enters and shoots a bird off Dolly Tate's hat, and then explains her simple backwoods ways to Wilson with the help of her siblings (""Doin' What Comes Natur'lly""). When Wilson learns she's a brilliant shot, he enters her in the shooting match against Frank Butler.While waiting for the match to start, Annie meets Frank Butler and is instantly smitten with him, not knowing he will be her opponent. When she asks Frank if he likes her, Frank explains that the girl he wants will ""wear satin... and smell of cologne"" (""The Girl That I Marry""). The rough and naive Annie comically laments that ""You Can't Get a Man with a Gun."" At the shooting match, Annie finds out that Frank is the ""big swollen-headed stiff"" from the Wild West show. She wins the contest, and Buffalo Bill and Charlie Davenport, the show's manager, invite Annie to join the Wild West Show. Annie agrees because she loves Frank even though she has no idea what ""show business"" is. Frank, Charlie, and Buffalo Bill explain that ""There's No Business Like Show Business.""Over the course of working together, Frank becomes enamored of the plain-spoken, honest, tomboyish Annie and, as they travel to Minneapolis, Minnesota on a train, he explains to her what ""love"" is (""They Say It's Wonderful""). Buffalo Bill and Charlie discover that their rival, Pawnee Bill's Far East Show, will be playing in Saint Paul, Minnesota while the Wild West show plays in nearby Minneapolis. They ask Annie to do a special shooting stunt on a motorcycle to draw Pawnee Bill's business away. Annie agrees because the trick will surprise Frank. She sings her siblings to sleep with the ""Moonshine Lullaby.""As Annie and Frank prepare for the show, Frank plans to propose to Annie after the show and then ruefully admits that ""My Defenses Are Down"". When Annie performs her trick and becomes a star, Chief Sitting Bull adopts her into the Sioux tribe (""I'm An Indian Too""). Hurt and angry, Frank walks out on Annie and the show, joining the competing Pawnee Bill's show. Act II Returning to New York from a tour of Europe with the Buffalo Bill show, Annie learns that the show has gone broke.  Sitting Bull, Charlie, and Buffalo Bill plot to merge Buffalo Bill's show with Pawnee Bill's as they believe that show is doing well financially. Annie, now well-dressed and more refined and worldly, still longs for Frank (""I Got Lost in His Arms"").At a grand reception for Buffalo Bill's troupe at the Hotel Brevoort, Pawnee Bill, Dolly, and Frank also plot a merger of the two companies, assuming Buffalo Bill's show made a fortune touring Europe. When they all meet, they soon discover both shows are broke. Annie, however, has received sharpshooting medals from all the rulers of Europe worth one hundred thousand dollars, and she decides to sell the medals to finance the merger, rejoicing in the simple things (""I Got the Sun in the Mornin'"").  When Frank appears, he and Annie confess their love and decide to marry, although with comically different ideas: Frank wants ""some little chapel,"" while Annie wants ""A wedding in a big church with bridesmaids and flower girls/ A lot of ushers in tail coats/ Reporters and photographers"" (""An Old-Fashioned Wedding""o). When Annie shows Frank her medals, Frank again has his pride hurt.  They call off the merger and the wedding, but challenge each other to one last shooting match to decide who is the best shot.On the ferry to the Governors Island match site, Dolly attempts to ruin Annie's chances by tampering with her guns.  She is caught and stopped by Sitting Bull and Charlie.  However, they then decide to follow through with Dolly's plan so that Annie will lose the match, knowing that would soothe Frank's ego allowing the two to reconcile and the merger to take place.As the match is ready to begin, Annie and Frank's egos come out again with each claiming they are better than the other (""Anything You Can Do""). Sitting Bull convinces Annie to deliberately lose the match to Frank, reminding her that she ""can't get a man with a gun.""  That done, Frank and Annie finally reconcile, deciding to marry and merge the shows.Notes:This description is based on the 1966 revised book.In the 1999 book, Frank also deliberately misses his shots in the final match, which ends in a tie.o written for 1966 revision and included in 1999 Broadway Revival; not in the original production§ omitted from the 1999 Broadway Revival","Charlie Davenport, who is the organizer of the show of shooters, does one next to the Wilson House hotel, in Cincinnati and the hotel’s manager is furious due to this because of some personal reasons. The main male character in the play is Frank Butler – he's one of the shooters, participating the show. After Wilson, owner of the hotel, met with the newcomer, Annie Oakley, who shown herself as an excellent shooter, he incite her to oppose the Frank Butler, without revealing all the secrets that he is also very good.

Then Charlie & Buffalo Bill persuade Annie to perform stunt riding on a motorcycle with shooting, and she agrees. Because of concern for her, Frank does not want that she would participate, but the stunting is still on, and the local rich Indian named Sitting Bull, amazed how well-armed shooter she is, wishes to adopt her and Annie agrees. After the show and ceremony of adoption, Annie receives a letter from Frank, saying that he left doing other show, along with Dolly and it devastates Annie.  Months later, the show, which involved Annie, have become broke and she gets good news that shows of her ex, Frank, subsidized by the government, and it turned out that both shows can be merged together, to be under one brand, and she agrees to see Frank.

Carousel,"  Act 1 Two young female millworkers in 1873 Maine visit the town's carousel after work. One of them, Julie Jordan, attracts the attention of the barker, Billy Bigelow (""The Carousel Waltz"").  When Julie lets Billy put his arm around her during the ride, Mrs. Mullin, the widowed owner of the carousel, tells Julie never to return. Julie and her friend, Carrie Pipperidge, argue with Mrs. Mullin.  Billy arrives and, seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous, mocks her; he is fired from his job. Billy, unconcerned, invites Julie to join him for a drink. As he goes to get his belongings, Carrie presses Julie about her feelings toward him, but Julie is evasive (""You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan""). Carrie has a beau too, fisherman Enoch Snow (""(When I Marry) Mister Snow""), to whom she is newly engaged.  Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that staying out late means the loss of Julie's job. Mr. Bascombe, owner of the mill, happens by along with a policeman, and offers to escort Julie to her home, but she refuses and is fired. Left alone, she and Billy talk about what life might be like if they were in love, but neither quite confesses to the growing attraction they feel for each other (""If I Loved You"").Over a month passes, and preparations for the summer clambake are under way (""June Is Bustin' Out All Over""). Julie and Billy, now married, live at Julie's cousin Nettie's spa.  Julie confides in Carrie that Billy, frustrated over being unemployed, hit her. Carrie has happier news—she is engaged to Enoch, who enters as she discusses him (""(When I Marry) Mister Snow (reprise))"".  Billy arrives with his ne'er-do-well whaler friend, Jigger.  The former barker is openly rude to Enoch and Julie, then leaves with Jigger, followed by a distraught Julie.  Enoch tells Carrie that he expects to become rich selling herring and to have a large family, larger perhaps than Carrie is comfortable having (""When the Children Are Asleep"").Jigger and his shipmates, joined by Billy, then sing about life on the sea (""Blow High, Blow Low"").  The whaler tries to recruit Billy to help with a robbery, but Billy declines, as the victim—Julie's former boss, Mr. Bascombe—might have to be killed.  Mrs. Mullin enters and tries to tempt Billy back to the carousel (and to her).  He would have to abandon Julie; a married barker cannot evoke the same sexual tension as one who is single.  Billy reluctantly mulls it over as Julie arrives and the others leave.  She tells him that she is pregnant, and Billy is overwhelmed with happiness, ending all thoughts of returning to the carousel.  Once alone, Billy imagines the fun he will have with Bill Jr.—until he realizes that his child might be a girl, and reflects soberly that ""you've got to be a father to a girl"" (""Soliloquy"").  Determined to provide financially for his future child, whatever the means, Billy decides to be Jigger's accomplice.The whole town leaves for the clambake. Billy, who had earlier refused to go, agrees to join in, to Julie's delight, as he realizes that being seen at the clambake is integral to his and Jigger's alibi (""Act I Finale""). Act 2 Everyone reminisces about the huge meal and much fun (""This Was a Real Nice Clambake"").  Jigger tries to seduce Carrie; Enoch walks in at the wrong moment, and declares that he is finished with her (""Geraniums In the Winder""), as Jigger jeers (""There's Nothin' So Bad for a Woman""). The girls try to comfort Carrie, but for Julie all that matters is that ""he's your feller and you love him"" (""What's the Use of Wond'rin'?"").  Julie sees Billy trying to sneak away with Jigger and, trying to stop him, feels the knife hidden in his shirt.  She begs him to give it to her, but he refuses and leaves to commit the robbery.As they wait, Jigger and Billy gamble with cards.  They stake their shares of the anticipated robbery spoils. Billy loses: his participation is now pointless. Unknown to Billy and Jigger, Mr. Bascombe, the intended victim, has already deposited the mill's money.  The robbery fails: Bascombe pulls a gun on Billy while Jigger escapes. Billy stabs himself with his knife; Julie arrives just in time for him to say his last words to her and die.  Julie strokes his hair, finally able to tell him that she loved him.  Carrie and Enoch, reunited by the crisis, attempt to console Julie; Nettie arrives and gives Julie the resolve to keep going despite her despair (""You'll Never Walk Alone"").Billy's defiant spirit (""The Highest Judge of All"") is taken Up There to see the Starkeeper, a heavenly official.  The Starkeeper tells Billy that the good he did in life was not enough to get into heaven, but so long as there is a person alive who remembers him, he can return for a day to try to do good to redeem himself.  He informs Billy that fifteen years have passed on Earth since his suicide, and suggests that Billy can get himself into heaven if he helps his daughter, Louise.  He helps Billy look down from heaven to see her (instrumental ballet: ""Billy Makes a Journey""). Louise has grown up to be lonely and bitter.  The local children ostracize her because her father was a thief and a wife-beater.  In the dance, a young ruffian, much like her father at that age, flirts with her and abandons her as too young.  The dance concludes, and Billy is anxious to return to Earth and help his daughter.  He steals a star to take with him, as the Starkeeper pretends not to notice.Outside Julie's cottage, Carrie describes her visit to New York with the now-wealthy Enoch.  Carrie's husband and their many children enter to fetch her—the family must get ready for the high school graduation later that day.  Enoch Jr., the oldest son, remains behind  to talk with Louise, as Billy and the Heavenly Friend escorting him enter, invisible to the other characters.  Louise confides in Enoch Jr. that she plans to run away from home with an acting troupe.  He says that he will stop her by marrying her, but that his father will think her an unsuitable match. Louise is outraged:  each insults the other's father, and Louise orders Enoch Jr. to go away.  Billy, able to make himself visible at will, reveals himself to the sobbing Louise, pretending to be a friend of her father.  He offers her a gift—the star he stole from heaven. She refuses it and, frustrated, he slaps her hand.  He makes himself invisible, and Louise tells Julie what happened, stating that the slap miraculously felt like a kiss, not a blow—and Julie understands her perfectly.  Louise retreats to the house, as Julie notices the star that Billy dropped; she picks it up and seems to feel Billy's presence (""If I Loved You (Reprise)"").Billy invisibly attends Louise's graduation, hoping for one last chance to help his daughter and redeem himself. The beloved town physician, Dr. Seldon (who resembles the Starkeeper) advises the graduating class not to rely on their parents' success or be held back by their failure (words directed at Louise).  Seldon prompts everyone to sing an old song, ""You'll Never Walk Alone"".  Billy, still invisible, whispers to Louise, telling her to believe Seldon's words, and when she tentatively reaches out to another girl, she learns she does not have to be an outcast.  Billy goes to Julie, telling her at last that he loved her.  As his widow and daughter join in the singing, Billy is taken to his heavenly reward.","Two young women, workers of the mill, back in 1873 come after work at local fair, to relax and to have fun. One of them, Julie, meets barker Billy on the carousel and they have a mutual admiration. Her friend, Carrie, betrothed to a wealthy fisherman Mr. Snow (When I Marry Mister Snow). Billy hugs Julie, as she rolls on the carousel, and the old hag, the owner of the entertainment, seeing the inappropriate, at her opinion, behavior of Julie, said she would never come back to this roundabout. She did not agree and Billy intercedes for Julie, immediately dismissed from job for having contradicted to a boss. The headmistress informs the employer of Julie about her behavior on the carousel, and after a while he is at the fair, accompanied by a police officer to escort her home. She refuses and he immediately fires her, not wanting to deal with wayward brawler.  A few months later, Julie and Billie got married, but Billie isn’t work on a permanent basis and all the time spends in the taverns with his fellow slackers. Julie confesses to her friend that her Billie even once hit her because he had a wave of the self-pity because he cannot find work. Her friend, contrary, feels well, because her husband plan to become rich and to have a huge family.  Jigger, which is scampish friend of Billie, tempts Billie so he went with him to the criminal case – robbery. Billy refuses because people may die during this. But when his wife tells him that she is pregnant, he soberly aware of the need of financial support of family and agrees to the proposal of Jigger. When they are on the case, it appears that the victim has no money at all and points at them with a gun. Jigger manages to escape, while Billie is on sight and in order not to be shot, stabs himself with a knife, which he took to crime. It comes his wife, who has time to tell him a few farewell words.  Billy faces after his death with Supreme Judge, who says that he cannot go to heaven because there are not enough good things in his life for that. But if he will go back and will help his daughter in life, which is now 15 years old, he can go to heaven. He returned to the earth and whispered to his daughter as an inner voice, that she should not be persecuted because of the past of his father. And she should not be an outcast because of past prejudices. She is free to choose the future, whatever it is. And his daughter feels these changes inside and understand them. And so Billie deservedly goes to heaven."
The Little Mermaid," of the Broadway Production  Act I Prince Eric, his nautical expert, Pilot, his adviser, Grimsby, and sailors are aboard a ship at sea, discussing the ""mythical"" merfolk that supposedly live under the sea. Grimsby wants Eric to return to court to fulfill his birthright as king. However, Eric hears a beautiful voice and commands it to be followed (""Fathoms Below"").Deep on the ocean floor in the merfolk kingdom, a concert in honor of a thwarted coup d'état by Ursula is underway, being performed by the daughters of Triton the sea king. King Triton's court composer, Sebastian the crab, has composed a song for girls to perform (""Daughters of Triton""). However, the youngest daughter, Ariel, is not there for her solo, bringing the concert to a halt. Ariel has forgotten about the concert and is swimming around the surface, admiring a new item for her collection, a fork. She reveals that she is fascinated with the human world (""The World Above""). Together with her best friend Flounder, Ariel visits Scuttle and his fellow seagulls to ask about the human things she's collected, and he explains them somewhat erroneously (""Human Stuff"").Elsewhere, the sea witch Ursula is planning revenge against her brother, King Triton. She was banished from the palace for using black magic, and tells her minions Flotsam and Jetsam to keep an eye on Ariel, whom she thinks will be the key to getting the crown and trident (""I Want the Good Times Back"").When Ariel returns home, she is berated by King Triton, who is angered to learn that she has been on the surface: King Triton is xenophobic towards humans, believing them to be nothing but savage fish-eaters. Ariel rushes off upset, and King Triton assigns Sebastian to watch over Ariel to make sure she doesn't get into trouble. Ariel sits alone in her grotto, which contains her collection of human things, and imagines living in the human world (""Part of Your World"").  Ariel and Flounder meet Scuttle at the surface to see Prince Eric's ship up close. On board, Grimsby tells Eric that he must find a bride and take his place as king. A storm suddenly hits, and Eric is tossed overboard. Ariel saves him from drowning and drags him to shore. She realizes that she is falling in love with him, and vows to find a way to be with him (""Part of Your World (Reprise)"").After Ariel returns home, her behavior makes her sisters and Flounder suspect that she has fallen in love (""She's in Love""). On land, Eric is determined to find the woman who saved his life, but the only clue he has is (""Her Voice"").  Sebastian reveals to King Triton that Ariel has saved a human. Triton angrily confronts her about it (""The World Above (Reprise)"") and uses his trident to destroy Ariel's human collection. After the king leaves, Sebastian tries to comfort Ariel by pointing out the wonders of the undersea world (""Under the Sea""), but she is furious with him for reporting to her father and sneaks off with Flounder during the song. Once she's away, she's stopped by Flotsam and Jetsam, who sweet talk her into seeking help from Ursula (""Sweet Child"").Ariel goes to meet Ursula, who presents a deal: Ariel will be turned into a human for three days, during which she has to win the kiss of true love from Eric. If she does, she will be human permanently; if not, her soul will belong to Ursula. In exchange, Ariel must give up her voice, which will stay in Ursula's magic nautilus shell (""Poor Unfortunate Souls""). Ariel signs the agreement and sings into the shell, after which she is transformed into a human and swims up to the surface. Act II Sebastian and Flounder bring Ariel, newly human, to shore. Scuttle and the seagulls give her a pep talk to raise her spirits and help her get used to her new legs (""Positoovity""). Eric arrives, but when Ariel tries to talk to him, she cannot speak. Eric brings Ariel back to his palace, where Carlotta, the head mistress, and the maids bathe and dress Ariel. Ariel is fascinated by the human world, while the maids wonder why Eric has brought such a girl to the palace (""Beyond My Wildest Dreams""). That night Chef Louis cooks dinner for Ariel, Grimsby, and Eric, and almost cooks Sebastian for the grand finale (""Les Poissons""/""Les Poissons (Reprise)"").Eric and Ariel spend time together, during which Eric teaches her to dance (""One Step Closer""). Meanwhile, Ursula is anxiously waiting for the three days to end and sends Flotsam and Jetsam to hurry things along (""I Want the Good Times Back (Reprise)""). After a tour of the kingdom, Eric takes Ariel on a quiet boat ride through a lagoon. Sebastian and Scuttle watch anxiously and try to create a romantic atmosphere for Eric to kiss Ariel (""Kiss the Girl""). As they are about to kiss, Flotsam and Jetsam give the boat an ""electric shock"", scare the animals away, and swim away gloating (""Sweet Child (Reprise)""). As the second day ends, Ariel wishes she had more time and could tell Eric everything, Triton worries about where his daughter has gone and vows to change if she were to return, Sebastian is concerned that Ariel's time as a human is almost up, and Eric still dreams of finding the girl who saved him even though he does not want to lose Ariel (""If Only (Quartet)""). Sebastian returns to the sea and tells an angry King Triton about Ariel's deal with Ursula.On Ariel's last day as a human, Grimsby has arranged a contest for all foreign princesses to sing for Eric, so he may choose one for his bride (""The Contest""). Eric isn't interested in any of them, and Ariel asks to participate, dancing for him. Eric picks her, but before they can embrace, Ursula appears, declaring that the sun has set and Ariel now belongs to her. Flotsam and Jetsam grab Ariel to take her back to the sea. King Triton arrives to confront his sister, agreeing to take Ariel's place. Ursula claims the trident and declares herself queen (""Poor Unfortunate Souls (Reprise)""). She banishes Triton with a wave of the trident. During a battle with Eric's ship, Ariel grabs Ursula's Nautilus shell and regains her voice (which causes a horrified Flotsam and Jetsam to swim away). Ursula begs Ariel to return the shell to her, as her power is contained within it, and even tries to sweet-talk her into doing so, saying she can turn her human again and reunite her with her prince. Ariel is torn, but ultimately destroys the shell just in time, which destroys Ursula and restores King Triton to his throne and daughter.Eric and Ariel are reunited on the beach, and Eric asks King Triton for his blessing to marry Ariel. King Triton says that it is Ariel's place to answer, and she accepts Eric's proposal. King Triton then says goodbye to his daughter (""If Only (Reprise)""). In honor of his daughter, Triton declares peace between the humans and merfolk. Ariel and Eric are married and sail away on a ship (""Finale""). Changes from the 1989 film In adapting the film into a live stage musical, the following significant changes are made:The shark chase sequence that introduced Ariel and Flounder early in the film has been replaced by a new introductory song for Ariel in which she admires a fork from ""The World Above"". Other new songs are ""Human Stuff"", ""I Want the Good Times Back"", ""She's in Love"", ""Her Voice"", ""Sweet Child"", ""Positoovity"", ""Beyond My Wildest Dreams"", ""One Step Closer"", ""If Only"" and ""The Contest"", and some songs from the film are extended, such as ""Fathoms Below"". ""Under the Sea"" is the same as the film version, but in the film it was performed while Sebastian is trying to stop Ariel from daydreaming about Eric; in the musical it occurs later, after King Triton destroys Ariel's collection of human things. In some later productions, however, the song is sung to try to stop Ariel from thinking about Eric like in the film.The musical depicts Ursula as King Triton's sister, a concept that was included in an early version of the film but did not make the final product. The musical's writer Doug Wright was given the early notes and scripts of the film, and used this element in adapting the story. In the final stage version, Ursula and Triton are explicitly equal, and upon the death of their father, Poseidon, she received a magic nautilus shell while he received the trident. Each ruled half the oceans, until her cruelty and use of black magic led to him deposing her and assuming full reign over the entire ocean world. Her nautilus shell embodies her power, while in the film it was merely a necklace she used to store Ariel's voice. Ursula also uses the shell to spy on Ariel, while in the film she used Flotsam and Jetsam for that purpose. In the musical Ariel defeats her by destroying the shell. She is destroyed when her shell is broken; she does not grow to monstrous proportions as in the film.In the reinvented version of the musical, Ursula and Triton had multiple older sisters, who were all killed by Ursula out of jealousy. When Ursula became the ruler of the seven seas, Triton overthrew her and became king, which is why she wants revenge. The magic nautilus shell was a gift to Ursula from Poseidon, to ease his guilt because he didn't give her as much attention as his other daughters. At the climax of the show it's revealed that Ursula is also responsible for the death of Ariel's mother.In the musical, the storm at sea sequence is simplified, and Eric merely falls overboard; his sheepdog, Max, is not included, and there is no gunpowder explosion. Ursula's alter ego, Vanessa, is also not included, thereby omitting the subplot of Eric's brainwashing, leading to ""The Contest"". In the film, Flotsam and Jetsam are killed when Ursula accidentally zaps them with the trident; in the musical they swim away after Ariel takes Ursula's nautilus shell.","Musical was delivered based on the work of the Danish storyteller Hans Christian Andersen, The Little Mermaid. Little beautiful mermaid named Ariel wants to know how people live in the mysterious world of the dry lands. Dreams of the Earth's life do not leave the marine girl: her small garden is decorated with things from sunken ships.  Once, during a shipwreck, Ariel rescues a handsome prince Eric, in whom immediately falls in love. Prince, who has been pulled to the shore by a mermaid, seems to be out of danger. The sounds of unearthly beautiful voice wakes him up. People rushing to the prince, scared Ariel away, and she was forced to hide in the ocean. Now the beloved ones separated: Eric wants to meet a beautiful stranger with a captivating voice, and Ariel’s thoughts are busy with reflections about meeting with her lover. Is her dreams destined to materialize? To do this, she needs to become a woman of the dry land, for whom the way into the depths of the sea will be forbidden. Accidentally, Triton, her father, learns about the secret of mermaid. Sea king's wrath is terrible, because he hates everything associated with people and with the living on the dry lands.  Ariel meets with followers of witch Ursula: moray eels Flotsam & Jetsam. They offer to help the little mermaid, convincing her that the sea witch Ursula can help the little mermaid Ariel to make her dream come true.  Ariel decides. Love is stronger than the anger of her father, the Sea King Triton, and fear of the unknown life among the people. Devoted fish Flounder supports his friend in her quest to find love.  But the conditions of the evil witch were harsh: the prince must kiss her within three days, otherwise the little mermaid will have to return to the depths of the sea, having arrived as slave to the witch Ursula. She is trying to interfere to beloved ones, taking the form of a beautiful maiden with a voice as that of Ariel, but friends of Mermaid help to break the spell. Prince is again in love with his charming savior. But time has been lost, and Ariel needs to go back into the depths of the sea. Not to get into her father's palace, but to become an eternal slave of Ursula. King tries to save his daughter, giving the crown and kingdom of the sea to the witch. But Prince Eric restores justice by helping Triton to become a king once again. As a reward for this, the Triton helps his daughter to become a maiden of the dry land, to find happiness with her lover, and completely differently starts to relate to people from the land."
Bye Bye Birdie,"  Act one New York–based songwriter Albert Peterson finds himself in trouble when his client, hip-thrusting rock and roll superstar and teen idol Conrad Birdie, is drafted into the Army, leaving his heavily indebted firm in jeopardy. Albert's secretary, Rose ""Rosie"" Alvarez, comes up with a last-ditch publicity stunt to have Conrad Birdie record and perform a song before he is sent overseas. Having long been stuck in a sort of romantic limbo for eight years, she longs for the Albert she once knew, an aspiring English teacher, before he wrote Conrad Birdie's first hit and abandoned those plans to pursue the seedier music industry (""An English Teacher""). Rose's plan is to have Birdie sing ""One Last Kiss"" (a song she assigns Albert to write on the spot) and give one lucky girl, chosen randomly from his fan club, a real ""last kiss"" on The Ed Sullivan Show before going into the Army.In Sweet Apple, Ohio, all the teenagers are catching  in on the latest gossip about 15-year-old Kim MacAfee and Hugo Peabody going steady (""The Telephone Hour"").

Kim reconsiders when, after a lengthy phone conversation with Ursula, she receives the phone call telling her she has been chosen to be Birdie's last kiss before going into the armed forces.Meanwhile, Conrad, Albert, and Rosie prepare to go to Sweet Apple. A crowd of teenage girls sees them off at the New York City train station, although one girl is sad because she thinks that by the time Conrad gets out of the army, she will be too old for him. Albert advises her to be optimistic (""Put on a Happy Face""). Soon, tabloid reporters arrive with questions about the seedy details of Conrad's personal life, but Rosie, Albert, and the girls answer for him, hoping to protect his reputation and bankability (""Normal American Boy"").Conrad receives a hero's welcome in Sweet Apple, and Hugo worries that Kim likes Conrad more than she likes him, but Kim assures Hugo that he is the only one she loves (""One Boy"").

Harry does not want Kim to kiss Conrad, until Albert tells him their whole family will be on The Ed Sullivan Show. Kim, Harry, Kim's mother, Doris, and younger brother, Randolph sing Sullivan's praises (""Hymn for a Sunday Evening"").Albert's overbearing mother, Mae, comes to Sweet Apple to break up her son's relationship with Rosie (she objects to Rosie's Hispanic heritage). She introduces Albert to Gloria Rasputin, a curvy blonde she met on the bus who could replace Rosie as his secretary. Gloria, a tap dancer, secretly hopes that a connection with Albert could be her way into show business. Mae sings ""Swanee River"" as Gloria tap-dances (usually depicted as her making a fool of herself). Albert gives Gloria a typing job. Rosie is furious and fantasizes about violent ways to murder Albert (""One Hundred Ways Ballet""), but instead comes up with a better idea: she convinces Hugo to sabotage the last kiss.Since both Rosie and Hugo are jealous and angry, they plot to ruin Conrad's appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show. On the broadcast, Conrad sings ""One Last Kiss"" and as he leans in to kiss Kim, Hugo runs onstage and punches him in the face, knocking Conrad unconscious. Rosie dumps Albert, and Albert, trying to cover for the mishaps of the evening, leads a chorus of ""Normal American Boy"". Act two Despite plans to re-film the broadcast, Rosie and Kim resolve to leave Albert and Hugo, lamenting their stupidity for having fallen in love (""What Did I Ever See in Him?""). Conrad, with no visible effects from being knocked out, decides he wants to go out and have a good time on his last night as a civilian, and encourages the Sweet Apple teens to party (""A Lot of Livin' to Do""). Kim sneaks out of her house and joins her friends. Conrad, Kim, and all the teenagers, except Hugo, head for the Ice House, ""where people go when they want to be alone.""

Maude sees that he's underage and refuses to serve him.When Harry discovers Kim has run away, he and Doris lament how disobedient kids are these days (""Kids""). Rosie ends up at Maude's Roadside Retreat and starts flirting with other men, but Albert phones her and begs her to return to him (""Baby, Talk to Me"").

Hugo and Albert rescue Rosie from the crazed Shriners, and Albert finally stands up to his mother, telling her to go home. Mae leaves, but not before lamenting the sacrifices she made for him (""A Mother Doesn't Matter Anymore""). Hugo tells the MacAfees and the other parents that the teenagers have gone to the Ice House, and they all declare that they don't know what's wrong with their kids (""Kids Reprise""). Randolph joins in, stating that his older sister and the other teens are ""so ridiculous and so immature"".The adults and the police arrive at the Ice House and arrest Conrad for attempted statutory rape. Kim, who unconvincingly claimed to be in her late 20s to Conrad, claims she was intimidated and gladly returns to Hugo. After a reconciliation with Albert, Rosie tells Mae that she will marry Albert despite Mae's racist objections, and despite being a natural-born American citizen from Allentown, Pennsylvania, she will deliberately play up her Hispanic heritage if it annoys Mae that much (""Spanish Rose""). Albert bails Conrad out of jail and arranges for him to sneak out of town dressed as a middle-aged woman, presumably so he can report for Army induction as scheduled; in turn, Conrad offers Albert a lifetime contract for bailing him out. Albert gets Mae to leave Sweet Apple on the same train, getting Conrad and his mother out of his life for good. Albert tells Rosie they're not going back to New York; they're going to Pumpkin Falls, Iowa, a small town in need of a (married) English teacher.

Billy Elliot the Musical,"  Act I In County Durham, the 1984–85 coal miners' strike is just beginning (""The Stars Look Down""). Motherless eleven-year-old Billy stays behind after his boxing class to give keys to Mrs. Wilkinson, who runs a ballet class. The class is all girls, but Billy is attracted to the grace of the dance (""Shine""). At first, Billy's interest in dance is easily concealed from his family, as the only person home at the time is his grandmother. She reveals to Billy the abuse she suffered at the hands of her late husband, but that she found great joy in dance (""Grandma's Song"").While his father Jackie, brother Tony and neighbours are on strike and clash with riot police, Billy takes dance lessons, keeping it a secret from his family (""Solidarity""). During the number, the violent reality of the strike is contrasted with the peaceful practise of ballet.Eventually, Jackie discovers Billy in the ballet class and forbids him from attending the lessons. Mrs. Wilkinson, who recognizes Billy's potential, privately suggests that he should audition for the Royal Ballet School in London. To prepare for the audition, she offers him free private lessons. Billy is not sure what he wants to do, so he visits his best friend Michael for advice. He finds Michael wearing a dress. Michael persuades Billy to have fun with him by dressing up in woman's clothing, rejecting the restrictive inhibitions of their working class community (""Expressing Yourself"").Arriving for his first private ballet lesson, Billy brings things to inspire a special dance for the audition (""Dear Billy (Mum's Letter)""). Through his lessons from Mrs. Wilkinson, he develops an impressive routine for his audition (""Born to Boogie""), as he forms a close bond with her. Mrs. Wilkinson's daughter Debbie tries to discourage Billy from auditioning because she has a crush on him.Meanwhile, Jackie and Tony are engaged in daily battles with riot police that often turn bloody. They struggle to support the family with very little in strike and union pay, a difficult task that goes on for nearly a year.When the day of the Royal Ballet School audition comes, the police come through the village, injuring Tony. When Billy fails to meet Mrs. Wilkinson at the union hall to leave for the audition, she goes to the Elliot home. There, Billy's family and some members of the community are gathered. She reveals that she has been teaching Billy ballet in preparation for this audition. The news upsets Jackie and Tony, who argue with Mrs. Wilkinson. Tony tries to force Billy to dance on the table in front of everyone. Suddenly the police approach and, as everyone escapes, Billy calls out to his father saying that his mother would have let him dance, to which Jackie says, ""Your Mam's dead!"". Billy goes into a rage (""Angry Dance""), and for nearly a year, stays away from anything related to ballet. Act II Six months later at the miner's annual Christmas show, the children put on a show disparaging Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, who is seen as the antagonist by the coal miners (""Merry Christmas, Maggie Thatcher""). Billy's father gets drunk and sings an old folk song that elicits memories of his deceased wife and the usually stoic man leaves in tears (""Deep Into the Ground""). Left alone with Billy in the Community Centre, Michael reveals he has feelings for him, but Billy explains that the fact that he likes ballet does not mean that he is gay. Michael gives him a kiss on the cheek. Michael tries to get Billy to show him some dancing, but Billy is sad and just tells him to leave.Michael departs, but leaves a music player running. Billy feels like dancing for the first time since the day of the aborted audition and dances while dreaming of being a grown-up dancer (""Swan Lake""). Unknown to Billy, his father arrives and watches him dance. Overcome with emotion, Jackie goes to Mrs. Wilkinson's house to discuss Billy's prospects as a dancer. She confirms Billy's talent, but is not sure whether or not he would get into the Royal Ballet School after missing the audition. Mrs. Wilkinson offers to help pay for the trip to London for the next audition, but Jackie refuses. He leaves questioning his working-class pride and the future mining has for his boys.Jackie decides the only way to help Billy is to return to work. When Tony sees his father cross the picket line, he becomes infuriated and the two argue over what is more important: unity of the miners or helping Billy achieve his dream (""He Could Be A Star""). The argument eventually comes to blows and Billy is hit accidentally. One of the miners chastises them for fighting and says that the important thing is looking after the child. One by one, the miners give money to help pay for the trip to the audition, but Billy still does not have enough for the bus fare to London. A strike-breaker arrives and offers him hundreds of pounds. An enraged Tony attempts to shun his donation, but no one else speaks up in his support. Now drained of hope, Tony dismally ponders whether there's a point for anything anymore, and runs off.Billy and his father arrive at the Royal Ballet School for the audition. While Jackie waits outside, an upper-crust Londoner highlights the contrast between the Elliots and the families of the other applicants. Jackie meets a dancer with a thick Northern accent. The dancer confesses that his father does not support his ballet career. He sharply advises Jackie to ""get behind"" his boy. Billy nervously finishes the audition with a sinking feeling that he did not do well. As he packs his gear, he lets that emotion overwhelm him and he punches another dancer who was trying to comfort him. The audition committee reminds Billy of the strict standards of the school. They have received an enthusiastic letter from Mrs. Wilkinson explaining Billy's background and situation, and they ask him to describe what it feels like when he dances. Billy responds with a heartfelt declaration of his passion (""Electricity"").Back in Durham, the Elliots resume life, but times are tough and the miners are running a soup kitchen to ensure everyone is fed. Eventually, Billy receives a letter from the school and, overwhelmed and fearful, knowing that it heralds the end of the life he has known, informs his family that he wasn't accepted. Tony retrieves the letter from the waste bin and discovers that his brother was accepted. At the same time, the miners' union has caved in; they lost the strike. Billy visits Mrs. Wilkinson at the dance class to thank her for everything she did to help him. Debbie is sad that Billy will be leaving.Billy packs his things for the trip to the school and says goodbye to the soon to be unemployed miners who are returning unhappily to work (""Once We Were Kings""). Billy says goodbye to his dead mother, who often visits him in his imagination (""Dear Billy (Billy's Reply)""). Billy breaks the fourth wall and begins to walk down the center aisle before Michael stops him to say goodbye. Billy drops his suitcase and runs onto the stage to give Michael a kiss on the cheek. Billy then walks back off stage, retrieves his suitcase and walks out to his future alone.The entire cast comes out on stage and calls Billy back to celebrate the bright future ahead of him (""Finale"").","In 1984, Billy, a boy of 11 years old, growing up without a mother, accidentally learns of a section of the ballet and he wildly likes it. Being the only boy there, he quickly mastered the movements. His grandmother tells the story of how she had lived for many years in an unhappy marriage (Grandma's Song) and this immerses us into the gloom of the life of the boy. His father forbade him to attend classes when has learnt about his passion, while the teacher, on the contrary, encouraged him to do so and said that he should go to the ballet school in London. Billy wants to consult with his friend, and accidentally sees him in the dress, because he wants self-expression, and the society does not allow it.  Teacher's daughter falls in love with Billy when he takes private lessons, preparing to enter the school. When that day came, his father and brother found out about his lessons and begin to make fun of him, and his father even said that his mother is dead, in response to his statement that she would allow him to study ballet. It throws him into a rage, and he gives up the ballet.  After some time, Billy hears the music, which is played in a large hall for meetings and it prompts him to recall the ballet’s movements and he starts dancing. In that time, his father accidentally watched him and was impressed with his talent. After talking with his teacher, he finds out that the guy is talented and somehow it is organized that entire municipality raises money for a ticket for Billy to London to auditions for ballet school. On admission, he reveals to the commission that he is experiencing the deepest feelings when dancing – as if the Electricity passes through his body. After a week, by the letter from the school, we learn that Billy is in. Now he leaves the family and thanks the teacher for everything. He thanked all those who supported him and even his friend, who was gay, for being supportive in his quest to the self-expression. And goes alone in the direction of his large bright future."
The addams family,"  Broadway version  Act I The ghoulish Addams family is visiting the graveyard for an annual gathering of all family members (living, dead, and undecided) to celebrate what it is to be an Addams (""When You're an Addams""). Uncle Fester stops the Ancestors' return to their graves to enlist their help. He explains that Wednesday, under protest, has invited her new (normal) boyfriend, Lucas Beineke, and his parents, Mal and Alice, to dinner. While torturing Pugsley on a rack, Wednesday admits that love is pulling her in a new direction (""Pulled""). Meanwhile, Wednesday’s parents, Morticia and Gomez, worry about her changing ways (""Where Did We Go Wrong"").As the Beinekes arrive, Wednesday and Lucas instruct their families to act normal so they can all enjoy a simple dinner (""One Normal Night""). But the moment Lurch ushers the Beinekes into the mansion, tensions begin to mount. Mal wants to tear down the old house, Alice begins to spout happy poems at random, Pugsley, Fester, and Grandma fail at acting normal, and Wednesday, after wearing black for eighteen years, appears in a bright yellow dress. Later, Lucas and Wednesday, away from their families, reveal that the reason they brought their families together is to announce that they are getting married. Gomez and Mal share a drink where Mal is introduced to Bernice, the family's giant pet squid, and Alice admits to Morticia that her marriage to Mal has grown passionless. Morticia then hears Wednesday call her old and worries that she's getting crows feet. She turns down Gomez's request to tango, leaving him alone and unsatisfied (""Morticia""). Meanwhile, Pugsley is worried that Wednesday's love life means she won't torture him anymore. He steals a potion from Grandma after she reveals it will bring out someone's dark nature. Pugsley plans to slip it to Wednesday at dinner (""What If?"").At dinner, ""The Game"" is played, where each person at the table confesses something (""Full Disclosure""). Gomez tells a story about scaring away crows and their feet, but upsets Morticia by accidentally comparing her to a goat, while Uncle Fester admits he's in love with the moon. In a mix-up, Alice drinks Pugsley's potion and in front of everyone declares her marriage to Mal a loveless mess as she reveals her misery and woe (""Waiting""). As Mal, humiliated, attempts to leave with his family, Wednesday announces that she and Lucas are getting married, to which Lucas sheepishly agrees. Chaos engulfs both families, and Uncle Fester, trying to be helpful, instructs the Ancestors to create a sudden, terrible storm, trapping everyone in the mansion for the night (""Full Disclosure – Part 2""). Act II During the storm, Wednesday tries to leave, but Lucas wants to stay and work things out with their families, leading the pair to have their first fight. Later, Morticia fears she is no longer relevant to her own family, and reminds herself that death is waiting for her (""Just Around The Corner""). Mal and Alice start to have a fight about their marriage at the dinner after Alice makes a poem that doesn't rhyme. Uncle Fester calls for an interlude as he plays his ukulele, singing a love song to the Moon (""The Moon and Me"").Walking out in the yard, Wednesday runs into Gomez. He is happy she's found someone to love, yet sad that his daughter is growing up (""Happy/Sad""). Wednesday is left worrying that she and Lucas are too different. Then as a show of trust, Lucas blindfolds Wednesday and lets her shoot an apple off his head with a crossbow (""Crazier Than You""). She succeeds, and the two embrace. Pugsley cannot sleep, and Morticia relaxes him a bit but he cannot bring himself to confess what he did to Alice. In the grotto, Gomez and Fester attempt to get Mal to open up about his feelings to no avail (""Let's Not Talk About Anything Else But Love""). He is ultimately kidnapped by Bernice and pulled into the sewers. Grandma, hearing the word ""love"", comes to sing with Gomez and Fester (""Let's Not Talk About Anything Else But Love"" (reprise)). Moments after, Alice is led down to the grotto by Lurch where Mal, now back from his swim with Bernice, has learned to appreciate what he has after spending time in the arms of a passionate squid and announces he still loves Alice (""In The Arms""). Gomez now goes up to the rooftop to profess his love for Morticia (""Live Before We Die""). They kiss and begin to tango (""Tango de Amor"").With all the couples reunited, Pugsley admits to slipping the potion to Alice, but is congratulated since it brought everyone together. Uncle Fester, wearing a rocket, tells everyone he is flying off to be with the moon. As the families sing one last ballad, they are all shocked as Lurch sings out loud for the first time, just as a puff of smoke is seen on the moon, signaling Fester has just landed (""Move Toward the Darkness""). US and UK touring version The national tours of the production changed the plot as follows. After the opening song, Uncle Fester addresses the audience directly about the love between Wednesday and Lucas, and states that the Ancestors will not be allowed to return to their graves until love prevails. Wednesday confesses her love of Lucas to Gomez but also makes him promise not to disclose her secret to Morticia until the two families all have dinner later that night. Morticia observes that Gomez is acting unusually, and this causes tension between them, especially because Morticia believes that Gomez has never lied to her before. When the dinner causes these secrets to be revealed, Morticia wonders if her marriage can be saved, and Mal and Alice also have disagreements. When Mal observes the sacrifice Lucas is willing to make to Wednesday by having the apple shot off his head, he reconciles with Alice. Gomez stops Morticia just as she is about to leave the family by reminding her that she acted the same way that Wednesday did when Morticia was younger. All plot references to the giant squid Bernice are completely removed, and some of the songs are either rearranged into new ones or completely cut altogether; most notably, the Act II song ""Let's Not Talk About Anything Else But Love"" is cut but portions of the lyrics are used in Act I with Fester's song ""Fester's Manifesto"" and a reprise titled ""But Love"".","The Addams family, living in the darkness and fully enjoys this Nosferratu's existence, once a year celebrates the gathering on their graveyard (itself a strange sight when your deceased relatives are in your backyard, and you each day can communicate with them on any issues disturbing you). Every year they arrange a rave for a meeting between the living, the dead and those who are still undecided (alluding to their butler).  After introducing the viewer into their dark atmosphere, the story tells that the daughter (with a strange name Wednesday) invited quite an ordinary boy Lucas Beineke on dinner along with his family. As she herself admitted, unusual feelings for this boy forced her to change a lot. She wants them to have just a normal dinner and were able to behave normally so she asks her family to do so, as if they are the average people. Of course, after the family of Beineke comes to them, Addams simply cannot behave normally and do their usual jokes and pricks.  Wednesday dressed for dinner in a bright yellow dress, plunging all into a shock, because for all 18 years before she got dressed entirely in black color. Pugsley, which Wednesday regularly tortured on a rim and rack, feels something like jealousy now, as she found a new love so she wouldn’t spend more time torturing him. He steals a potion of truth from Grandma, in the hope that Wednesday will drink it (he planned to slip her this potion), and in a burst of revelation, tell everyone that she is not really in love with her chosen, Lucas.  Meanwhile, the viewer becomes aware of the dialogue of Lucas and Wednesday that the real reason why they have gathered their families together is to declare them of their upcoming wedding. Another person drinks potion (during The Game) and Wednesday announced their common plans with Lucas. Everyone starts to run and rave and Uncle Fester organizes a storm using a help from the ancestors so this cuts off all of them from the outside world for this night.  Wednesday wants to leave, but Lucas has different opinion and in the end, they swear. Like their parents do. Uncle Fester flies on Moon, because he is in love with it. Then Morticia and Gomez understand that swearing is for nothing and Gomez apologizes to his wife and they happily dancing tango, the same, as they love it to do. Pugsley admits the theft of potion, and not abused, but congratulated by all, because everything came out well in the end."
School of Rock - the Musical,"  Act I The musical begins with a performance by the band No Vacancy. The band's guitarist, Dewey Finn, repeatedly attempts to upstage the lead singer (""I'm Too Hot for You”) which leads to the band agreeing to kick him out for his antics after Dewey leaves the stage. The next morning, Dewey is awoken in his bedroom by his longtime friend, Ned Schneebly, and Ned's domineering girlfriend, Patty Di Marco. Patty demands rent from Dewey while Ned cowers behind her. After they leave, Dewey goes about his day, getting kicked out of his band and fired from his job at a record store, all while dreaming about getting his break and becoming a superstar (""When I Climb to the Top of Mount Rock""). Afterwards, Dewey receives a call from Rosalie Mullins, principal of the prestigious Horace Green School. She asks to speak to Ned, saying that the school has an open substitute teacher position that will pay over nine hundred dollars a week—enough to meet the rent. Dewey, pretending to be Ned, accepts.At Horace Green, Rosalie does her best to keep everything running smoothly while greeting parents who come to drop off their children (""Horace Green Alma Mater""). Dewey arrives late both hungover and unprepared for the day, and the principal warns that ""Ned"" will be expected to meet the school's high standards (""Here at Horace Green""). Dewey enters his classroom and introduces himself as Mr. Schneebly. His thirteen students are immediately wary of him, and one of them, uptight Summer Hathaway, attempts to explain to him how the classes run, and Dewey is disgusted by the rigid system. With no food to treat his hangover, Dewey spends most of the day sleeping, leaving the students to run wild.At the apartment, Patty asks Ned to go on a jog with her, but he declines, claiming he has a lot of papers to grade. Understanding, Patty goes. As soon as she's gone, however, Ned pulls out his Guitar Hero console and begins playing. When Dewey comes home, he joins Ned and they discuss various topics such as teaching and their old band (""Variation 7”). After their game, Dewey attempts to convince Ned to rejoin him in their music career, by reminding him of all the perks of being a rockstar (""Children of Rock”). However, Patty arrives and breaks the men's reminiscing session up. Angry at Dewey, Patty reminds him that he's nothing more than a dreamer who will never succeed in the rock business, and gives him an ultimatum: pay the rent in thirty days, or they'll kick him out (""Mount Rock (Reprise)"").The next day at school, Dewey argues with another teacher and hears music coming from one of the classrooms. Upon learning that his students are in music class with Rosalie (""Queen of the Night""), he inquires in amazement about what instruments they play. Dewey then tells his students that they're now a part of his new band set to compete in the Battle of the Bands. First, he puts together the instrumentals of his band: Zack on electric guitar, Katie on bass, Lawrence on a keyboard, and Freddy on drums. He also makes two of the girls—Shonelle and Marcy—backup singers, and two other girls—Madison and Sophie—roadies. Then he moves onto technical jobs. Mason is put in charge of lights, James is made the security officer, and an ecstatic Billy is made the band's stylist. Summer is angry that she hasn't been given a job and says ""groupies are sluts"" in response to Dewey's first suggestion. Dewey then makes her the band's manager. The only student left without a job is Tomika, the shy new girl (""You're in the Band""). Confident about their prospects, Dewey hands out famous CDs to the students to listen to as homework (""You're in the Band (Reprise)”).The children go home, and a glimpse is seen in some of their home lives. Freddy tells his father about the music he was assigned to listen to, but his father belittles him, saying that he's not smart like the other children at Horace Green. In another part of town, Billy is reading a Vogue magazine disguised as Sports Illustrated due to pressure from his father to take up football. Elsewhere, Tomika tells her fathers that she's not making friends or doing well in her new school, but her parents dismiss her since they love Horace Green. Finally, Zack attempts to talk to his father about his day, but his father is on a business call and shouts at Zack for trying to speak to him, telling him to go away. Frustrated, Zack, Tomika, Billy, Freddy, and the other students lament that they have so much to tell and offer their parents and the world, but they just won't listen to them yet (""If Only You Would Listen""). Later, Shonelle and Marcy say that they should call the band School of Rock. Dewey loves it, and makes up a song to create the impression that he is prepared (""In the End of Time (A Cappella Version)"").In the Faculty Lounge, the other teachers complain that the children have become undisciplined under Dewey (""Faculty Quadrille""). In the classroom, the band continues practicing Dewey's new song (""In the End of Time (Practice Version)""). After playing, Dewey tells everyone they're doing great. However, Zack is playing in an uptight and rigid manner, and Dewey says that Zack needs to get angry at ""the Man"" in order to really rock. He explains that the man is responsible for everything wrong with the world, and Dewey and the kids get angry and shout about how they're going to stick it to the Man (""Stick it to the Man""). Due to being stuck in school, Dewey and the kids end up sneaking out of the building in order to make it to the Battle Of The Bands auditions on time. The children and Dewey sadly arrive late at the auditions, With the manager about to leave, Summer convinces him to stay with a lie about a terminal illness and the class is able to compete (""In the End of Time (The Audition)""). They qualify and celebrate their success (""Stick it to the Man (Reprise)""). Act II Thirty-six hours before the Battle of the Bands, the students are hard at work preparing for the event while Dewey attends a faculty conference. The students conclude that the one outstanding issue is the costumes, which Billy has yet to show anybody. He argues that they aren't finished yet, but Summer makes him show them anyway. Billy, using Lawrence as an unwilling model, shows everyone, and they hate them. Billy, annoyed but not disheartened, goes back to the drawing board (""Time to Play""). At the faculty meeting which Rosalie uses to stress the importance of parents' night, Dewey discovers that she is secretly a rocker, and loves Stevie Nicks. Dewey panics when he gets back to the classroom and begins to think of a cover. Tomika summons the courage to speak to him saying that she wants to sing. When Dewey asks why she didn't respond to the call for backup singers, she states that she's a lead singer. Although initially too nervous, Tomika begins to sing when others are not looking and captivates her audience (""Amazing Grace"").Upon hearing that Rosalie is coming, students quickly cover their instruments with Thanksgiving-themed items and Dewey breaks into a fake lesson. When she challenges this, Dewey accuses other teachers of being on crack before admitting that he uses music to teach ""boring"" subjects. After arguing that there are no boring subjects, Rosalie announces that she'll be sitting in for the rest of Dewey's lesson. Nervous, Dewey pulls out his guitar and improvises a song about math (""Math Is a Wonderful Thing""). Rosalie is unimpressed, but Dewey decides to ask her out to a bar regardless. Later that night, Rosalie and Dewey meet at the bar, and, after having a few drinks, Dewey plays a Stevie Nicks song on the jukebox, causing Rosalie to let loose and laments about how she feels she's lost her inner music. Stating that Dewey has reminded her about it, she promises that if the parents' meeting goes well the next day, she'll help Dewey and School of Rock go to the Battle of the Bands (""Where Did the Rock Go?""). Dewey impulsively kisses Rosalie, and they part ways.Dewey arrives home just as Patty and Ned are going through the mail. Prompted by the discovery of Dewey's paycheck made out to Ned, Dewey explains his impersonation idea. Ned goes into a panic attack, but Dewey manages to calm him down and make him promise not to tell Patty. The next day, the students go to rehearse their song, but then Zack reveals that he wrote his own song for the band in his free time. Dewey is floored by Zack's talent, and has Zack teach the song to the rest of the band (""School of Rock (Band Practice)""). However, in the middle of the practice, Rosalie unwittingly brings the students' parents into the classroom, and they are appalled by what is going on. Focusing on the talent of each child, Dewey slowly convinces the parents to see the band in a positive light until Patty and Ned burst in. Having extracted the information from Ned, Patty reveals that Dewey is not Ned Schneebly and sends the parents into a rage. In the commotion, Dewey and the children escape going to the Battle (""Dewey's Confession"").As Rosalie paces nervously in the halls, she finds Mason and reminds him that Dewey isn't who the students think he is. Mason counters that he is a role-model regardless of his name. Touched by this, Rosalie misleads the parents to buy the children more time. The children use this time to reinvigorate Dewey who has given up on his dream and returned to his room. Led by Tomika, they all explain how much they need him (""If Only You Would Listen (Reprise)""). Patty makes one last attempt to stop them but Ned finally stands up to her and accompanies them to the Battle. The band arrives just as No Vacancy is finishing up their performance (""I'm Too Hot For You (Reprise)""). Dewey decides that they should play Zack's song and accepts new costumes from Billy. The parents arrive but are not allowed backstage by the security guards. As the students go to perform, Zack's father begins shouting at his son, telling him that School of Rock is ridiculous and stupid. Zack, finally having enough, stands up to his father and tells him that the band means more to him than he does, and then Zack goes to play.The School of Rock performs Zack's song and the crowd goes wild. Their parents watch on from an empty box seat, and each of them slowly fall in love with the band and how amazing their children are. Each of the instrumental students gets a solo, and Tomika sings lead with Dewey as well. By the end, Zack's father is frozen with pride and has to be pulled away by Summer's mother (""School of Rock (Teacher's Pet)""). After the performance, Rosalie and the band's parents congratulate the group, as well as Ned who has decked out in full heavy metal gear for the Battle. Dewey watches the parents and their kids, and finally feels as though he has accomplished something worthwhile. The winner of the competition is announced as No Vacancy, but Dewey assures everyone that winning didn't really matter because they did something even more special. Patty then enters with a police officer and tries to get Dewey arrested for fraud, but Rosalie convinces the officer that Mr. Finn is Horace Green's official Band Coach. To please an enthralled crowd, the band plays an encore (""Stick It to the Man (Encore)""). After their song, Dewey and Rosalie kiss again, and Rosalie mixes her classical singing with the heavy rock music of School of Rock, implying that a change is coming to Horace Green and its curriculum because of the band and Dewey (""Finale"").","After guitarist Dewey was kicked out of a rock band, he introduced himself with the name of his friend, so with such a fraud to be employed to a school. Such actions a young man was forced to do to pay the rent of the room he hired from a friend and his passion. Ned & Patty gave him 30 days to find the money. The director did not notice the substitution and Dewey started teaching. Suffering from a hangover and hunger, he tried to send someone from the students for a sandwich. But then he learned that the children are not allowed to leave school during classes. Exhausted false teacher slept all the lessons in a row and his students have entertained themselves. Back at the apartment of a friend, Dewey tried to draw Ned to creation of a new rock band. The appearance of Patty swayed all plans of friends.  In the morning, the young man learned that his students knew how to play musical instruments. Dewey told the children about the creation of a school rock band. He distributed instruments among the students, appointed a manager and announced that they will participate in the upcoming competition. Then Dewey gave the students home CDs with classics of rock. Trying to share the news with their parents about creating a band, the children met indifference and incomprehension. They realized that they aren’t heard, and decided to convey to the world their feelings. In the morning, the children came up with a name for the band – a team became known as ‘School of Rock’. Dewey wrote a song on the run together with his students that they had to perform at the competition. Teachers negatively perceived such an unusual fellow. According to them, the children began to behave worse after communicating with a new teacher.  After school, Dewey slipped out of the school with the students – they had to pass the audition in order to participate in the competition. But suddenly it turned out that the casting was completed. The manager of band ‘Summer’ talked with the organizers of the contest and they were allowed to participate. Then Dewey learned that the girl spoke about the deadly disease, of which children allegedly suffered. Soon was expected visit to the school by parents, so the teacher had to work diligently with the children. Suddenly Dewey learned that director Rosalie was a secret admirer of rock direction. The teacher was in shock, but he was more alarmed of evening for parents – he had to prepare any presentation with the children. In addition, the event took place during the competition of rock bands. Trying to figure out how to combine these events, Dewey chose a soloist to ‘School of Rock’. Soon, the young man was able to win the support of director – Rosalie promised to help with carrying out the evening for parents and with the participation in the competition.  After receiving a check payment for the work, Ned learned that his friend has appropriated his name and position. Dewey was able to convince the other no to report it to the Director and Patty. Soon, one of the students wrote a song. Dewey was impressed by his talent. During rehearsals of the band, parents accidentally entered in the room. They rebelled, seeing that their children were not learning, but Dewey was able to show the positive side to adults of such communication between students. Suddenly in the class appeared Ned and Patty. Women exposed Dewey, telling the director and parents, that he was not a real teacher. Frustrated guitarist left the school. But children still decided to take part in the competition. With the help of the director, they were able to go to Dewey and to convince him that everything wasn’t lost yet.  Upon arrival to the competition, the students began to prepare for the performance. Soon there were their parents, but adults were not allowed backstage. Wearing costumes made on the basis of school uniforms, the students sang a song of their classmate. After that, parents were able to understand the feelings of their own children. Despite the fact that another band was announced as the winner, all were satisfied with the performance of the school community. Suddenly the hall began to call ‘School of Rock’ for an encore. Director no longer was able to hide her love for rock. Rosalie decided that school needed discipline on this subject, and Dewey must teach it."
The Rocky Horror Show,"  Act I The Usherette, sometimes referred to as ""Trixie"", who works in a derelict cinema, introduces tonight's ""film"" in a song (""Science Fiction/Double Feature""), with masked Phantoms providing the backing vocals.After attending the wedding of his best friend since high school (Ralph Hapschatt, now married to Janet Weiss' friend Betty Munroe), Brad Majors confesses his love to Janet Weiss (""Dammit Janet"") and the two become engaged. The Narrator appears and explains that Brad and Janet are leaving Denton to visit Dr Everett Scott, their former science tutor, while driving into a rainstorm. During the trip, their car has a flat tire and they are forced to walk through the rain to seek a telephone in an old castle (""Over at the Frankenstein Place"").The Narrator explains that Brad and Janet are feeling ""apprehensive and uneasy"", but must accept any help that they are offered. As Brad and Janet arrive, Riff Raff, the hunchbacked handyman and live-in butler, greets them, and his sister Magenta, the maid, appears. Riff Raff, Magenta and Columbia (a groupie) speak briefly of an unlucky delivery boy named Eddie who fell victim to unfortunate circumstances because he botched a delivery, before performing the show's signature dance number (""Time Warp""*). Brad and Janet try to leave at this point, but are stopped when Dr Frank-N-Furter, a pansexual, cross-dressing mad scientist, arrives. He introduces himself as ""a sweet transvestite from Transsexual, Transylvania"" and invites Brad and Janet up to his laboratory (""Sweet Transvestite""). As he goes up, Brad and Janet are stripped to their underwear to dry off.Brad and Janet enter the laboratory, where Frank-N-Furter gives them laboratory coats to wear. Frank announces that he has discovered the secret to life itself. He unveils his creation, a blond, well-built man named Rocky, who is brought to life. As his bandages are removed, Rocky worries about his predicament (""The Sword of Damocles""). Frank admires Rocky's physique by singing a tribute to muscle builders (""Charles Atlas Song""/""I Can Make You a Man""**). A Coca-Cola freezer in the laboratory opens to reveal Frank and Columbia's former lover, Eddie, a biker covered in surgical scars, who has been rendered a (slightly more) brain-damaged zombie, intent on rescuing Columbia, and escaping the castle while successfully causing large amounts of damage to Frank's laboratory, exhibiting signs of partially returning memory of the way he lived life in the past (""Hot Patootie – Bless My Soul""). Frank panics, forces Eddie back into the freezer and hacks him to death (his weapon of choice typically being a pick axe or chainsaw). Frank tells Rocky — the recipient of the other half of Eddie's brain — that he prefers him over Eddie (""Charles Atlas Song (Reprise)""/""I Can Make You a Man (Reprise)""**), as although he and Eddie had a strong mental relationship, he had no muscle, and therefore, had to go. Brad and Janet, somewhat flustered after witnessing the re-murdering of Eddie, are then ushered to separate bedrooms for the night. Act II The Narrator foreshadows that Brad and Janet may be unsafe. Janet enjoys Brad's advances in her darkened bedroom before realizing that it is Frank in disguise. He convinces Janet that pleasure is no crime, and after she asks him to promise not to tell Brad, they resume their lovemaking. The scene changes to Brad's darkened bedroom, where Brad makes love to Janet before discovering that, once again, it is Frank in disguise. Frank promises not to tell Janet, but as they resume, Riff Raff interrupts on the television monitor with the message that Rocky has escaped. Janet searches for Brad in the laboratory and discovers Rocky hiding there. Checking the television monitor, Janet sees Brad in bed with Frank and seduces Rocky (""Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch-a, Touch Me""). While searching the television monitor for Rocky, the rest of the group discovers that Janet has slept with him and Brad becomes hurt and angry (""Once in a While""). Riff Raff then notifies Frank that there is another visitor entering the castle: Dr. Everett Scott, the paraplegic science tutor whom Brad and Janet intended to visit.Dr Scott is pushed into the laboratory by Columbia, where Frank accuses him and Brad of trying to investigate his castle, knowing that Dr Scott has connections with the FBI. Dr Scott assures him that he has come in search of Eddie, who is revealed to be his nephew (""Eddie's Teddy""). Frank displays Eddie's corpse to the group and then uses a device to electronically restrain the three visitors and a rebellious Rocky to the floor (""Planet Schmanet Janet""); the inhabitants of the castle are revealed to be space aliens led by Frank, who abandoned their original mission in order to engage in kinky sex with Earthlings and work on Rocky. Magenta insists that they return to their home planet now that they have been found out; Frank refuses and, instead, declares his intentions to put on a ""floor show"".Under Frank's influence, Columbia, Rocky, Brad, and Janet perform song and dance routines while clad in lingerie (""Rose Tint My World (Floor Show)""). After, Frank entices them to lose all inhibition and give in to their natural carnal instincts, resulting in everyone beginning to engage in orgiastic sex (""Don't Dream It – Be It"") before Frank leads them into the rousing concluding number of the floor show (""Wild and Untamed Thing""). The show comes to an abrupt end when Riff Raff and Magenta enter, wearing spacesuits and carrying ray guns. Riff Raff declares that he is usurping Frank's authority and taking them all back to their home planet (""Transit Beam""). Frank makes a final plea for sympathy from Riff Raff, trying to make him understand his desire to spend the rest of his life having sex with Earthlings (""I'm Going Home""). Riff Raff is unmoved and guns down Columbia, Frank, and Rocky before ordering Brad, Janet, and Dr. Scott to leave.As the trio evacuates the castle, Riff Raff and Magenta express their excitement to return to their world and do the ""Time Warp"" again with their fellow Transylvanians (""Spaceship""). Brad and Janet watch as the castle blasts off into outer space, confused about the implications of their sexual escapades (""Super Heroes""). To conclude his tale, the Narrator says ""and crawling on the planet's face, insects called the human race, lost in time, and lost in space – and meaning."" As the show ends, The Usherette returns to recount the night's events (""Science Fiction/Double Feature (Reprise)"").In the original London and Los Angeles productions, ""Sweet Transvestite"" came before ""Time Warp"". This was changed for the film version and was subsequently updated for the stage version when O'Brien revised the script for the 1990 West End revival.""Charles Atlas Song"" was replaced by a reworked version of the song, ""I Can Make You a Man"", for the film version. O'Brien's revision of the script in 1990 featured a hybrid of the two songs under the title ""I Can Make You a Man"", in the 1999 revised script this song was replaced by the film, which continues to be used in all major productions. The reprise remains unchanged except for the title.","In the center of the story are two young people Brad and Janet. They are present at the wedding of their friends. Solemn atmosphere and romance in the air causes the protagonists to follow the example of the couple and to engage. But before upcoming wedding, they go on a journey, which main goal is to visit a college professor. In the past, it was thanks to him that Brad and Janet met and started dating. To reduce the way a little, a pair decides to ride through the forest. However, the terrible weather, coupled with poor visibility (they were driving at night) leads to breaking of a car down and there is no way to fix it right there. Brad and Janet decide to walk on foot, because they wouldn’t get help in these area. They see some light in the distance. Coming closer, the characters see a big and slightly sinister castle. Nearby the massive doors, they encounter at Riff-Raff and his sister Magenta. The appearance of the latter ones seriously frightened engaged pair. They were about to walk on, but worsening weather forced them to postpone the departure. Subsequent events that are demonstrated on stage, best described in one word – insanity. Every minute it gains only ascending, with all new paints and destroying conventional frameworks of acceptable behavior. The personification of insanity is best felt in one person – a doctor-transgender from Transylvania named Frank N Furter. He instantly gets interest in unexpected guests and to tell them about his views on the life, owner of the castle sings Sweet Transvestite.  Frank takes protagonists in the scientific lab. However, there performed not quite standard experiments. Dr. gets Brad and Janet acquainted with his latest creation – a half-naked muscled blonde named Rocky. To revive him, evil genius used a half of brain from guy used to named Eddie. The main aim, why Rocky was created is to satisfy any sexual requests of local residents, including the owner of the castle. Next, the couple sees Eddie. Even in the absence of half of the brain, he can move and talk. He sings the song ‘Whatever Happened to Saturday Night’, and then Frank deprives him of life. After such terrible and inexplicable events, as if nothing had happened, Brad and Janet led to separate rooms.  Quite expectedly, night wasn’t confined solely to sleeping. The main characters without desire were involved in a dirty game, the initiator of which was transgender doctor. Janet has an affinity with Frank, thinking that next to her was Brad. With the latter, exactly the same situation occurs. Next Rocky comes into play, which, using the clouded mind of a young couple, shows various facets of pleasure and debauchery to them. All this is happening against the background of constant fun. To get out of the castle, the main characters need to recall who they are and what the main purpose of their trip is. The finale of the musical looks as logical conclusion of demonstrated events of spectacle. That is fully consistent with the main events."
Thoroughly Modern Millie," Act IIt's 1922, and Millie Dillmount has just arrived in New York City from Salina, Kansas. Determined to become a success, she tears up her return ticket (""Not for the Life of Me""). Bobbing her hair, she assumes the modern look of a ""flapper"" (""Thoroughly Modern Millie""). But she is quickly mugged on the streets of New York, losing her hat, scarf, purse and a shoe. In a panic for someone to help her, she trips bypasser Jimmy Smith, a handsome, carefree young man who makes his way through life on whims and wits, who promptly lectures her on why she needs to head back home: she is just another girl full of false hopes who doesn't belong in the big city. Almost taking his advice, she changes her mind and yells after him, ""Who needs a hat? Who needs a purse? And who needs YOU, mister whoever-you-are?!""and soon takes a room at the Hotel Priscilla for Single Women (""Not For the Life of Me [reprise]"").A week later, Millie is confronted by the hotel proprietress, the mysterious and sinister Mrs. Meers, a former actress who now works for a white slavery ring in Hong Kong, kidnapping pretty unsuspecting orphan girls and shipping them to the Orient, which she has just done to Millie's hall mate, Ethel Peas. Mrs. Meers declares that Millie ""has two minutes to pack, or find her things on the street!"" But then Millie meets the wealthy Miss Dorothy, who wants to learn how the poorer half lives (""How the Other Half Lives""), and wants a room in the Hotel Priscilla. Millie, seeing this as a way to get her rent paid, suggests that Miss Dorothy can room with her until she can find her own, but only if Miss Dorothy pays the rent.  Mrs. Meers comes out of her office, saying Millie can get a rent extension, and Miss Dorothy can take the ""nice, sunny room that just become available, right next to Millie's."" When Millie asks what happened to her old neighbor, Ethel, Mrs. Meers says she got an acting job in the Orient. Millie and Miss Dorothy then go up to their rooms, tap dancing to get the elevator to start.In the Hotel Priscilla laundry room, two Chinese immigrants, Ching Ho and Bun Foo, are working for Mrs. Meers to earn enough money to bring their mother from Hong Kong over to the states (""Not for the Life of Me [reprise]"").After researching some of the richest and most eligible bachelors in the world, Millie comes to Sincere Trust not only looking for a job, but also to set her sights on the company's boss, Trevor Graydon III (""The Speed Test""). Her lightning speed stenography easily lands her the job. Meanwhile, Ching Ho attempts to capture Miss Dorothy for Mrs. Meers with a drugged apple but when he sees her, he falls in love with her instantly and wants to save her from Mrs. Meers. Before Dorothy eats the drugged apple, Millie arrives (Mrs. Meers has to act like she was getting a stain out of the carpet with ""soy sauce"") with the good news that she has found a job and a boss to marry. As the girls rush off to their rooms, Mrs. Meers thinks about how stupid the girls are to never realize she's an evil mastermind trying to ship them to Southeast Asia (""They Don't Know""). To celebrate their success the girls go to a speakeasy, where they meet Jimmy, but the club is raided by the police. While waiting for his release in the jail cell, Jimmy realizes that he loves Millie (""What Do I Need with Love"").Jimmy asks Millie to a party hosted by famous singer Muzzy van Hossmere, and she accepts. Before the party Muzzy sings of her love for New York (""Only in New York""). At the party, Millie spills wine on Dorothy Parker's dress, which Millie tries to get out with soy sauce, following Mrs. Meers' example. After the party, Millie explains to Jimmy how she is going to marry Trevor. She also tells him off for being a ""skirt chaser"" and ""womanizer."" As they argue, Jimmy suddenly grabs Millie and kisses her, then runs away. Millie realizes that she loves Jimmy (""Jimmy""). Millie returns to the hotel and overhears a conversation between Miss Dorothy and Jimmy, ""I really want to tell her, she's my best friend"" followed by ""You know we can't"". Millie sees Jimmy sneaking out of Miss Dorothy's room after what appears to be a late-night tryst; confused and horrified, Millie decides she never wants anything to do with Jimmy ever again.Act IIAt Sincere Trust, Millie tells the other stenographers that she is ""completely over"" Jimmy, then realizes she is still in love; the girls try to convince her to let him go (""Forget About the Boy""). Millie places more conviction into marrying Graydon, but when Dorothy comes to visit Millie at work, Mr. Graydon is immediately smitten with her instead (""Ah! Sweet Mystery of Life""/""Falling in Love with Someone""). The two set up a date together. While Millie is brooding over her lost chances, Jimmy breaks in through the window and asks her to dinner. She initially tells him off but then agrees (""I Turned the Corner""/Falling in Love with Someone"" (Reprise)).Back at the Hotel Priscilla, Mrs. Meers along with Ching Ho and Bun Foo get ready to drug Miss Dorothy, when Ching Ho refuses because he loves her. Mrs. Meers stops his ranting by reminding them of why they work for her, to raise money to see their mother again. She convinces them to go along with the plan (""Muqin"").Jimmy finally declares his feelings for Millie while washing dishes to pay their tab at Cafe Society while Muzzy is performing her hit (""Long As I'm Here with You""). Millie is confused by her feelings for Jimmy and her desire not to be poor and initially rejects him. She runs to Muzzy, who tells her she's a fool for throwing away true love for the sake of money. She tells the story of how she met her late husband, a supposedly poor but goodhearted man who gave her a green glass necklace. Regardless of his income status, she loved him anyway, and she later realized that her green glass necklace was actually genuine emerald. Millie reconsiders her feelings and finally realizes that she would rather have a green-glass love with Jimmy (""Gimme, Gimme"").Just as she returns to Jimmy to confess her feelings, they encounter Graydon, who was stood up by Miss Dorothy for their date, and is drunkenly singing, annoying Dexter and his wife, Daphne, who are also on a date. Graydon tells Millie and Jimmy that Mrs. Meers told him Miss Dorothy had checked out of the hotel. When Millie recalls that several other tenants had also suddenly ""checked out"", and that all of them were orphans, Millie, Jimmy, and Graydon realize what Mrs. Meers is doing. They persuade Muzzy to pose as a new orphan in town to trick Mrs. Meers, who takes the bait, is exposed as the mastermind of the slavery ring, and is then taken to the police station. Meanwhile, Ching Ho had already rescued Miss Dorothy and won her heart.Jimmy proposes to Millie, and, poor as he is, she accepts, ""because if it's marriage I've got in mind, love has everything to do with it."" Jimmy turns out to be Herbert J. van Hossmere III, Muzzy's stepson, and one of the most eligible bachelors in the world. And Miss Dorothy turns out to be his sister, an heiress named Dorothy Carnegie Mellon Vanderbilt van Hossmere, and (unlike the 1967 film) she ends up not with the dismayed Trevor Graydon, but with Ching Ho. Muzzy reveals that to help Jimmy and Dorothy avoid getting caught by fortune-hunters, she sent them out into the world so that they could find spouses who weren't in it for the money. Both Jimmy and Dorothy had disguised their family name to avoid being found out as society heirs. In a final pairing, Bun Foo joins Graydon's company as a new stenographer after telling Graydon that he can type fifty words a minute. At the very end of the musical (after the bows), Bun Foo and Ching Ho are once again reunited with their mother.","A young girl Millie comes to New York from the province in 1922.

Legally Blonde,"  Act One The overjoyed girls of UCLA's sorority Delta Nu, led by Margot, Serena, and Pilar, celebrate the engagement that is expected to happen that night of Warner Huntington III to their perky, sweet, and strikingly blonde sorority president, Elle Woods, who is fretting over finding the perfect dress for the occasion (""Omigod You Guys""). Once she acquires her dream dress, Elle goes to dinner with Warner, where he tells her that he needs someone more serious and breaks up with her (""Serious""). Elle is devastated and sulks for twelve days (""Daughter Of Delta Nu"") but decides to chase Warner to Harvard Law School to show him that she can be serious. With help from Delta Nu sister Kate, Elle studies for the LSATS. Instead of writing a personal essay, Elle bursts into the Harvard admission offices backed by a squad of cheerleaders. She is accepted after revealing she is motivated by love (""What You Want"").Elle's snobby classmates disapprove of her attire, and the only person who is willing to help her is law-teaching assistant Emmett Forrest (""The Harvard Variations""). However, he can't protect her in class from the bloodthirsty Professor Callahan (""Blood In The Water""). Callahan kicks the under-prepared Elle out of class at the suggestion of her classmate Vivienne Kensington, who happens to be Warner's new girlfriend. This ""tragedy"" summons the apparitions of the sisters of Delta Nu, who, acting as a Greek Chorus visible and audible only to Elle, encourage her to stay positive (""Positive""). Elle, believing that being blonde is the problem, decides to become a brunette. She heads to the Hair Affair salon where she meets the spunky beautician Paulette, who, after talking Elle out of her hair-dye plan, tells Elle that when she is down, she puts on her favorite CD, Celtic Moods, and dreams of Ireland and her dream Irishman (""Ireland""). At the salon, Vivienne gives Elle an unexpected invitation to a costume party. Paulette sends Elle off with a costume for the party with lyrics of encouragement (""Ireland (Reprise)"").Walking into the party as a Playboy Bunny, Elle soon realizes that she was tricked by Vivienne: no one else is wearing a costume. Despite this, she still seeks out Warner in an effort to win him back, but he remains unimpressed (""Serious (Reprise)""). Elle runs from the party, only to meet Emmett, who struggles to understand Elle's love problems. He has Elle assess her priorities until she realizes it is her obsession with Warner that keeps her from earning his respect (""Chip On My Shoulder""). Freed from her need to please Warner, she defeats him in a classroom debate. Elle then helps Paulette get her dog back from Paulette's ex-boyfriend, using legal jargon and demonstrating she is beginning to understand law. Along with Enid Hoopes, Warner and Vivienne win two of Callahan's coveted internship positions, and Warner proposes to Vivienne on the spot right in front of Elle. Vivienne accepts with a kiss. Elle is devastated, but Emmett shows her the internship list, revealing Elle got an internship position as well. Elle, overjoyed, celebrates, disses Warner, calls her mother to tell her the news and eagerly anticipates the trial (""So Much Better""). Act Two Act Two begins with fitness queen Brooke Wyndham and her fitness team's workout video, which is being viewed by Elle, Callahan, Emmett, Vivienne, Warner, and Enid (""Whipped Into Shape""). Callahan tells the legal team that Brooke is accused of murdering her billionaire husband. At the jail, the legal team is unable to get Brooke to tell them her alibi and she refuses to plead guilty. Upon learning that they were both Delta Nu sisters, Brooke then privately tells Elle her alibi: Brooke was getting liposuction, which, if the public finds out, could destroy her fitness empire. She makes Elle promise not to tell anyone (""Delta Nu Nu Nu""). Because of Elle's loyalty to her client and refusal to state the alibi, Elle, and consequently Emmett, are shunned by the group. To cheer Emmett up and to increase his chances of impressing Callahan, Elle gives him a makeover (""Take It Like A Man"").Back at the Hair Affair, Elle is getting a manicure when Kyle, a sexy UPS courier, walks into the salon to deliver a package to Paulette, leaving her in complete awe, but her low self-confidence prevents her from making a move. When he leaves, Pilar, Serena, and Margot are summoned by Paulette's amazing ""Bend and Snap"" when picking up the package. The sorority girls tell Paulette to use the ""Bend and Snap"" dance move on Kyle to turn him on, but when she does, she accidentally breaks his nose (""Bend and Snap"").At the trial, Brooke's pool boy Nikos claims to have been having an affair with Brooke, giving her a motive for murdering her husband. After doing the Bend and Snap in front of Nikos and getting no response, Elle suspects that Nikos is gay although Callahan and her teammates are not convinced.  Her colleagues posit that his perceived flamboyance might just be a cultural difference as Nikos is European. Emmett successfully makes Nikos slip and state that his boyfriend's name is Carlos, though Nikos claims that he misunderstood ""boyfriend"" for ""best friend"". Carlos, fed up with the closeted nature of his boyfriend, appears from the gallery and proclaims Nikos's homosexuality. Nikos confesses that he is indeed gay and European (""There! Right There! (Gay or European?)"").Later that night in Callahan's office, the interns celebrate Elle's skill. Warner finds problems with calling a finely tuned awareness of homosexuality a legal victory. Callahan, annoyed with Warner's behavior, sends Warner out of the room to fetch a coffee. Callahan dismisses Emmett and the other interns but requests Elle to remain for a few moments. Callahan forcibly kisses Elle, who slaps him. In turn, Callahan fires her. Warner and Vivienne both see the kiss through the door of the room. Warner turns away in anger, leaving Vivienne to be the only one to witness the slap. After Callahan leaves, Warner re-enters the office and mocks Elle, but Vivienne tells him to shut up and they both leave. A defeated Elle prepares to go home, despite Emmett asking her to stay, finally realizing that he is in love with her (""Legally Blonde"").Elle heads to the Hair Affair to say goodbye to Paulette, but before she can leave, Vivienne and Enid convince Elle otherwise. Elle discards her lawyerly navy suit, dons a pink dress and leads a parade back to the courtroom. They meet Kyle on the way, who has taken a liking to Paulette, and reveals himself to be Irish, prompting everyone present to Irish Dance. Back at the trial, Brooke fires Callahan and hires Elle (""Legally Blonde Remix""). Brooke's stepdaughter Chutney goes to the witness stand and her testimony is damning, stating after she got out of the shower she saw Brooke covered in her father's blood. After Chutney states she received a perm the day of the murder, Elle realizes a flaw in Chutney's alibi and suggests that the entire court should be moved to the scene of the crime - the bathroom where the murder took place (""Scene of the Crime""). As a demonstration, Elle asks Paulette to give Enid a perm and asks Enid to step into the shower upon entering the crime scene. Relying on her knowledge of hair maintenance, Elle's demonstration is successful as Enid walks out of the shower with completely flattened hair—revealing that Chutney couldn't have possibly showered immediately after getting a perm because her perm was still intact. Under Elle's intense questioning, Chutney confesses that she killed her father, thinking that it was Brooke (""Omigod You Guys (Reprise)""). Chutney is arrested and Brooke is set free. Warner proposes to Elle, having been dumped by Vivienne. Elle gently refuses, claiming to have been changed by the experience. Three years later, Elle ends up as the valedictorian of her class. Paulette tells the audience that Elle is not one to brag about her valedictorian status, so she decided to allow Paulette to play ""Where Are They Now"" during her speech. Paulette says that Enid practices family law, Vivienne is training for the Peace Corps, and Warner dropped out to pursue a modeling career. Callahan ran for governor but was defeated, and his wife hired Emmett to handle their divorce. Paulette married Kyle, had two kids and is pregnant with a third. They live in Worcester, Massachusetts and Paulette bought a new salon (the Worcester detail was taken from the London script, and replaced with the detail that a child of hers was named Seamus) (""Find My Way""). At the end of the graduation, Elle proposes to Emmett, and Emmett accepts (""Finale"").","Actions carry musical’s spectators in the University of California, where there’s gonna be a holiday in one of the girlish communities named Delta Nu. A local princess Elle Woods should get a marriage proposal from her partner Warner Hantington. The whole community is on their feet, friends of the main character choose her dress, as well as help in every possible way to organize a holiday. However, instead of the long-awaited wedding Elle is going to be abandoned. Girl falls into a depression. All attempts to cheer her by friends do not lead to any result.  One day, still in battered condition, Elle sees in a magazine the photography of brother of her ex-fiancé. From the article, the main character learns that her fiancée has become a student of the Faculty of Law. At this point, she decided on a bold and serious act – to give up all the entertainment and other delights of the last year of study for admission to Harvard. On what specialty? Of course, to be a lawyer. Elle said that by getting such a prestigious education, she can return Warner.  The main character begins with great desire to study, which further gives the result. Elle passes the most difficult exams. There were some small tricks, such as a mild flirtation with the examining committee. Natural charisma and the ability to enjoy are impossible to take away from this girl.  The school year starts. Despite the grandiose expectations, Elle immediately falls into a ridiculous situation. All would be okay, but the culprit of this confusion of the protagonist is Vivienne – a new girlfriend of Warner. In any other situation, this could lower your arms, but Elle is not like that. A girl needs practical advice on how to proceed. At this point, Elle’s loyal friends visit her in imagination in the form of a Greek chorus. After a series of consultations on a subconscious level, the heroine comes to the conclusion that it is necessary to disguise into brunette. Unfortunately, this idea turns into a big failure. Fuel to the fire adds Warner, claiming that Elle will not be able to hold out for a long time in Harvard.  The only one who could see the potential of the protagonist becomes an assistant of teacher named Emmett Forrest. He gives a girl all kinds of training, as well as psychological support. As a result, out of a sudden, Elle wins Warner on one of the classrooms. Most of all Professor Callahan was surprised, who from that moment begins to see in the face of the heroine a young perspective lawyer. This is the first, but a long-awaited victory for our blonde. Having provided Paulette an assistance in the return of her dog, Elle finally understands why she is studying law.  The professor posts at the housing wall a favorites’ list, which will be trained with a very complicated and confusing case of Brooke Wyndham. The latter is accused of murdering her husband. Unexpectedly, Elle falls in the number of students selected by Callahan. Her joy has no limits. Even news that Warner and Vivienne decide to get married, cannot spoil the mood of the girl. The above events commemorate not only close up the first act of the musical, but also the beginning of the transformation of the main character. From that moment, she ceases to be a mild princess, wishing to return her boyfriend. Now Elle Woods is Legally Blonde, and her main task is to win her case come what may."
Godspell,"  Act I The show opens with God's voice, as spoken by Jesus, declaring his supremacy: ""My name is Known: God and King. I am most in majesty, in whom no beginning may be and no end."" (""Opening (Monologue)""). The cast then enters and takes the roles of various philosophers who sing their philosophies, first alone, then in cacophonous counterpoint (""Prologue: Tower of Babble"").In response, John the Baptist enters blowing a shofar to call the community to order. He then beckons them to ""Prepare Ye, The Way of the Lord!"" and baptizes the cast (""Prepare Ye""). John gives a short sermon, as Jesus watches quietly. Jesus then announces his presence and says that he also wishes to be baptized. John instead asks to be baptized by Jesus. Jesus explains that ""We do well now to conform with all that God requires"" and is baptized by John. The cast enters and sings with Jesus (""Save the People"").In his first parable, Jesus explains that he has come ""not to abolish the law and the prophets, but to complete"". Jesus explains to the cast that those who adhere to the law of God will earn the highest place in the Kingdom of Heaven. He tells them the parable of the Widow and the Judge, demonstrating that God is a just jurist who will support those who cry out to him.The cast begins to understand Jesus' teachings and take it upon themselves to tell the story of the Pharisee and the Publican praying in the temple: ""Every man who humbles himself shall be exalted!""As Jesus teaches the law of the offering gifts at the altar, the cast makes offerings of themselves. They are taught that to approach God's altar, they must be pure of heart and soul. They then act out the Parable of the Unforgiving Servant a story of a master and a servant who owes him a debt. The servant asks his master for pity in repaying the debt, and the master absolves it. The servant then turns to a fellow servant who ""owed him a few dollars"" and demands that it be paid in full. The master, hearing this, then condemns the servant to prison. Jesus explains the moral: ""Forgive your brothers from your heart."" The character telling the parable sings ""Day by Day"", and the cast joins in. After the song, Jesus teaches that if one part of you offends God, it is better to lose it than to have the whole of the body thrown into hell.The cast then plays charades to finish several statements posed by Jesus, including ""If a man sues you for your shirt..."" and ""If a man asks you to go one mile with him...."" The cast then performs the Parable of the Good Samaritan as a play-within-a-play. Jesus explains the need to ""love your enemies"" and ""not make a show of religion before men"". He says: ""God will reward a good deed done in secret"" (""Shhh! It's a secret!"").The cast then performs the parable of Lazarus and the rich man. On earth, the rich man feasts, and Lazarus begs and is ignored. Upon dying, Lazarus is rewarded with Heaven, while the rich man is in Hell. The audience is told to ""Learn Your Lessons Well"" or be faced with eternal damnation. When the rich man asks Abraham if he would send Lazarus back from the dead to warn his brothers of their impending doom, Abraham tells him no: ""If they do not listen to Moses and the Prophets, they will not be convinced even if someone should rise from the dead.""Jesus teaches that no man can serve two masters (God and money). A member of the cast tells a story of a man who spent a lifetime acquiring the good things in life, then dies before he has the time to enjoy them. This character sings ""Bless the Lord,"" then Jesus tells the cast not to worry about tomorrow: ""Tomorrow will take care of itself. Today has problems of its own.""In an antiphonic chorus, the cast recites the Beatitudes. Judas directs the final beatitude regarding persecution at Jesus, and Jesus quickly changes the subject (""Did I ever tell you that I used to read feet?""). However, Jesus then persuades the cast that it is ""All for the Best"" and heaven contains the ultimate reward as Jesus and Judas do a soft shoe together.This is followed by the parable of the Sower of the Seeds, which Jesus tells them represent the Word of God (""All Good Gifts"").By this point in the musical, the group has transformed from a rag-tag cast, into a community of love and caring and now march as soldiers in the military, signifying their ability to think as one. With Jesus as the drill sergeant, they perform the Parable of the Prodigal Son. The cast sings ""Light of the World"" about Christ's Light and how it shines in each person. Intermission Jesus thanks the audience for coming and announces a 10-minute intermission.There is audience interaction during intermission. In the original production, the cast joined the audience for wine and bread. In the 2011 Broadway revival, the audience was offered wine on the stage.The second act then opens with one or more cast members singing ""Learn Your Lessons Well"", calling the audience back to their seats. Act II After the reprise of ""Learn Your Lessons Well"", a member of the cast sings ""Turn Back, O Man"", imploring mankind to give up its temporal pursuits and turn to God. Jesus then says: ""This is the beginning.""Several members of the cast then begin to question Jesus's authority, and he responds with yet another parable. He is asked, ""What is the greatest commandment?"" and responds, ""You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and all your soul... And the second is like it: 'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"" The Pharisees continue to question him, and he laments ""Alas for You"" and calls them hypocrites. Members of the cast gather, join in Jesus' song, and throw garbage at the Pharisees.Jesus predicts that he will not be seen for quite a while, while standing at the ""Wailing Wall"", and predicts great wars and famines. He reminds the cast and audience of the time of Noah and teaches that faith can calm the storm. The cast is told: ""Keep awake, then. For the Son of Man will come at a time when you least expect it.""One woman in the cast is shunned as an adulteress. Jesus says: ""Let the one of you who is faultless cast the first stone."" Her accusers then bow their heads and walk away. Jesus walks over to her and asks: ""Woman... where are they now? Has no one condemned you?"" The woman answers: ""No one, sir."" He tells her: ""Then nor shall I. You may go, but do not sin again."" As she watches Jesus walk from her, she entreats him to remain ""By My Side"". During this song, Judas foretells his upcoming betrayal of Jesus.In one of the lighter moments in the second act, Jesus tells how he will separate men as a shepherd separates his flock into sheep and goats. The sheep will enter heaven while the goats must suffer eternal damnation. ""We Beseech Thee"" cry the goats, begging for mercy.After the song, the cast reminds each other to take things ""Day By Day"", as they remove their clown makeup, face paint, or object. They assemble for the Last Supper and Jesus tells them that one of them will betray him. Each member of the cast asks, ""Is it I?"" ending with Judas: ""Rabbi... can you mean me?"" Jesus tells him to do quickly what he must do and Judas runs off. Jesus breaks the bread and shares the wine, while saying the traditional Hebrew Seder blessings. He tells his followers that they will dine together in the Kingdom of Heaven. The band sings ""On the Willows"", which is about what has been sacrificed. In the song, Jesus says goodbye to the cast. He asks that they wait for him as he goes into the Garden of Gethsemane to pray.In the garden, Jesus implores God to let the burden be lifted from his shoulders if there is another way. Jesus returns to his followers to find them all asleep. He begs them to stay awake, but they all fall asleep again and Jesus warns them they will all betray him three times (a reference to the apostle Peter). Jesus then prays to God that if his death cannot pass him by, then His will must be done. He is then tempted by Satan (usually played by the apostles), but orders him away.Judas returns to betray Jesus, but has a moment where he cannot bring himself to do it. Judas finds himself boxed in by invisible walls, except for one path which leads to Jesus. Jesus encourages Judas to do what he has come to do, and Judas grabs Jesus to bring him to be crucified. The community starts to attack Judas, while Jesus tells them to stop, as all who live by the sword will one day die by it. Judas (usually alone, as a representation of the others arresting Jesus) ties Jesus upon an electric fence (representative of the cross) as Jesus berates him for arresting him at night, but then says that it had to happen to fulfill the prophets' writings.The ""Finale"" begins, loud and in B-minor, with Jesus wailing, ""Oh, God, I'm bleeding,"" and the community answers: ""Oh, God, You're bleeding."" Jesus dies and the music ends. The women of the cast sing ""Long Live God"", and the men join in with ""Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord"" in counterpoint. The cast removes Jesus from the fence and carries him out, either offstage or through the aisles. The cast then finishes with a reprise of ""Prepare Ye the Way of the Lord,"" ending the show full of love and faith. Ending interpretation Similar to criticism of the 1970 rock opera Jesus Christ Superstar there is controversy over there being no obvious allusion to the  Resurrection of Jesus in the show. It can be interpreted that either the singing of ""Prepare Ye"" in the finale or the curtain call, where all including Jesus return to the stage, represents the resurrection. The Music Theatre International script states that while either representation is valid.","The musical starts from the voice of God, whom we don’t see. A group of people sings fragments of the philosophical sayings, merging in dissonant chorus. Then John the Baptist appears. He baptizes people & preaches. After that, all members sing together with Jesus. Christ is announcing that his followers should live according to a Scripture to get to Heaven. He promises to always support those who ever ask him for help. Company starts understanding the Saint & his learning. He teaches them to present gifts on an altar, & they do such presentations. They learn that to come closer to God's altar, they have to be pure with soul & thoughts. Later they represent history of the owner & servant who ran into debt to him. The sense is in forgiving the brothers in all sincerity. Jesus teaches them that if one their part sinned against the Lord, it is better to lose it, than entirely get into a hell.  The community plays a parable of the Good Samaritan. Messiah explains that it is necessary to love the enemies & says that any blessing made of pure thoughts is rewarded. The following that Jesus tells is a parable about the rich man & Lazarus, which teaches that everyone is rewarded according to his doings. One of the people tells a story about the person, who all the life got good things & died earlier, than managed to take pleasure of them. God says that nobody should worry about tomorrow. In the following parable, when the turn reaches Judas, he begins persecutions on Jesus, & Jesus changes a subject.  Further, we understand that the purpose of this meeting was to make a society of love & care from the separated company, which thinks as a unit. To reflect it in the musical, they march as soldiers in army with Jesus as the chief sergeant. One of the community sings a song where he urges Mankind to forget about the conflicts & turn to God. Pharisees challenge Jesus’ power, & he calls them hypocrites while other people sing together with him & throw garbage in betrayers. Jesus foretells that he will be gone for a quite long time; also he foretells long wars & hunger. However, he learns that belief is capable to calm a storm.  Further Jesus tells how he will divide people just as the shepherd divides the herd into sheep & goats. Goats will expect eternal suffering, & sheep will get on Heavens. The community gathers for the last dinner & Jesus says that one of them will betray him. Each of attendees asks, whether it is he or not, including Judas. Christ treats the audience with bread & wine & leaves them for the Garden of Gethsemane for praying. Later he comes back to the followers & finds them sleeping. He asks them not to sleep, but they don't obey him, & he warns them that they will betray him three times. Jesus says to God that if he can't avoid death, his will has to be executed.  Judas comes back to betray Jesus, but, surrounded with invisible walls, he sees only one way, leading to Jesus. When the company tries to stop the traitor, Jesus stops them, saying that who will come with a sword, lately will suffer from it. He also says that it had to happen on a prediction. Jesus dies & music abates. Women & men sing, glorifying God."
How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying,"  Act I J. Pierrepont Finch, a young window cleaner in New York City, reads the book How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying as he works. The ""Book Voice"" tells him that he will succeed if he follows the book's advice. He enters the World Wide Wicket Company searching for a job (""How To Succeed"").Finch bumps into J.B. Biggley, the president of the company, who dismisses him to the personnel manager, Mr. Bratt. Rosemary Pilkington, an ambitious young secretary, helps Finch meet Mr. Bratt. Finch tells Bratt that Biggley sent him, and Bratt gives him a job in the mailroom, where he works with Mr. Biggley's lazy, arrogant, and nepotism-minded nephew Bud Frump. Rosemary dreams of a life with Finch in the suburbs (""Happy To Keep His Dinner Warm""). The fatigued workers rush to get their coffee break (""Coffee Break""). In the mailroom, Finch earns favor with the long-time head of the mailroom, Mr. Twimble, who tells him the secret to longevity at the company (""The Company Way"").Twimble is promoted to head of the shipping department and has to choose his replacement as head of the mailroom. The book warns not to stay in the mailroom too long, so Finch recommends Frump instead of himself. Twimble is reluctant to promote the lazy Frump, but Frump promises to be a good employee (""The Company Way (Reprise)""). Twimble and Bratt are impressed by Finch's apparent selflessness, and Bratt offers him a job as a junior executive in the Plans and Systems department, headed by Mr. Gatch.An extremely attractive but air-headed woman named Hedy LaRue, who is Mr. Biggley's secret mistress, is hired as a secretary. On her first day of work, the male employees are instantly attracted to her, but Mr. Bratt warns them against taking advantage of their employees (""A Secretary Is Not a Toy""). Finch learns from Mr. Biggley's secretary, Miss Jones, that Biggley is a proud alumnus of Old Ivy college. In the elevator at the end of the workday, Rosemary's fellow secretary Smitty helps her and Finch set up a date (""Been a Long Day""). Frump runs into Biggley and Hedy and realizes their relationship, and he blackmails Biggley into giving him a promotion (""Been a Long Day (Reprise)"").Finch arrives early Saturday morning and sets up the office so it looks like he has been working all night. Biggley believes Finch's ruse, and Finch convinces Biggley that he, too, is a proud alumnus of Old Ivy (a ""Groundhog""), and they sing the Old Ivy fight song (""Grand Old Ivy""). Biggley insists that Finch be given his own office and secretary, Hedy. With the book's help, Finch realizes that Biggley must be Hedy's advocate and sends her on an errand to Gatch, knowing that Gatch will make a pass at her. Gatch falls for the trap and is dispatched to Venezuela, and Finch is promoted to his position as head of Plans and Systems.At a reception for the new Advertising Department head, Benjamin Burton Daniel Ovington, Rosemary hopes to impress Finch with her new ""Paris original"" dress, but all the other women arrive at the reception wearing the same dress (""Paris Original""). Frump schemes for Biggley to catch Finch kissing LaRue in his office, but after LaRue blackmails Finch into kissing her, he realizes he's actually in love with Rosemary (""Rosemary""). After some farcical complications, Frump and Biggley walk into the office just as Finch embraces Rosemary. Ovington is forced to resign when Biggley learns that he is a graduate from Northern State, Old Ivy's bitterest rival (a ""Chipmunk""). Biggley names Finch Vice-President in Charge of Advertising. Biggley leaves as Finch and Rosemary declare their love for each other, and Bud Frump vows revenge (""Act I Finale""). Act II Two days later, Rosemary has been neglected by Finch. She decides to quit, but her fellow secretaries convince her to stay because she's living their dream of marrying an executive. (""Cinderella, Darling"") (In the 1995 revival, this song was replaced with a reprise of ""How to Succeed"", with the lyrics suggesting ways in which a woman can get hold of a man's financial assets).The book warns Finch that because Vice-President of Advertising is a bad position, he needs a brilliant idea. Bud Frump slyly tells Finch his idea for a treasure hunt, which Finch loves, unaware that Biggley has already heard the idea and rejected it. Finch shares the idea with Rosemary, who tells him that she'll stay with him no matter what happens (""Happy To Keep His Dinner Warm (Reprise)""). Hedy tells Biggley that she is unhappy as a secretary and is leaving for California. He begs her to stay and tells her he loves her, and she agrees to stay (""Love From a Heart of Gold""). In the executive washroom, Finch gives himself a pep talk while, behind his back, the other executives and Frump plot against him (""I Believe In You"").Finch presents ""his"" idea to Biggley: he will hide five thousand shares of company stock in each of the ten offices around the country and give a television audience weekly clues as to their whereabouts. Biggley accepts this idea when Finch explains that each clue will be given by the scantily-dressed World Wide Wicket Treasure Girl: Miss Hedy LaRue.During the first television show, Hedy is asked to swear on a Bible that she doesn't know the location of the prizes. Hedy panics and reveals the locations to the entire television audience, which prompts all the Wicket employees to tear apart the offices looking for them. The book tells Finch, ""How To Handle a Disaster. ...We suggest that your best bet if you are the cause of the Disaster is to review the first chapter of this book: 'How to Apply for a Job'.""The executives, including Chairman of the Board Wally Womper, are waiting in Biggley's office for Finch's resignation. Rosemary again tells Finch that she'll stand by him no matter what (""I Believe in You (Reprise)""). About to sign his letter of resignation, Finch mentions that he'll probably go back to washing windows. Womper is drawn to Finch as he, too, was a window washer and they both ""had a book"": Wally's book was a book of betting records. Finch blames the treasure hunt on Frump, also mentioning that Frump is Biggley's nephew. Womper is about to ""clean house from top to bottom"", when Finch steps in on everyone's behalf. Finch tells the executives that even though the business world is a place filled with betrayal and competitiveness, the World Wide Wicket staff is like a family to him (""Brotherhood of Man""). Everyone is spared except Frump, who is fired because he is Biggley's nephew.Biggley remains president, Womper retires to travel the world with his new wife, Hedy, and Finch becomes Chairman of the Board. Rosemary stands by his side and inadvertently inspires him to aspire for the Presidency of the United States. Frump gets a job washing windows, swearing revenge against Finch (""Company Way (Finale)"").","The main character Finch works as a washer. Once, he finds a book about business, but decides not to try to begin. However, the internal voice prompts him that he needs to try. Finch meets Mr. Biggley, the director of the post, and his beautiful secretary, who acquaints him with Mr. Brett. The guy receives a job connected with mail. The lazy snob Bud becomes an employee of Finch. The secretary after some time dreams to live together with Finch.  During a break, the guy meets the director of the post office, Mr. Twimble, who tells him about the secrets of successful business. Soon he is invited to higher position, and he wants to find a replacement. He suggests Finch to take his place. However, his book prompts that he shouldn't remain on the mail for a long time, therefore, he refuses. In exchange, he suggests taking Bud, but the director doesn't want to see such a lazy person on this place. However, he promises that he will be a good worker. Finch is suggested to hold a new position. Now he is the junior head in a department of a prestige firm.  An attractive woman works in this office. Actually, she is Mr. Biggley's lover. Finch learns that Mr. Biggley graduated from an old prestigious college, and pretends that he has been studying at this place too. The man trusts him. Bud falls in love with his mistress, and now he is dismissed. So, Finch becomes a head of the firm. Finch and Rosemarie make a declaration of love to each other. The book says that Finch has to create his own unique idea. Bud offers him a search of treasures. The guy agrees. He doesn't know that Mr. Biggley already know about this idea and rejected it.  Finch says to Rosemarie about his idea and she supports him. He also describes it to Biggley himself, and this time, the director agrees. They create a television show. The key role belongs to Biggley’s mistress. During the first telecast, they ask her to say that she doesn't know, where the treasures are. The scared girl tells secrets to all the audience. The alarm begins. Finch thinks that now he has to work as a washer again. However, Womper (the chairman of the board) goes to travel all over the world and the guy takes his place. Rosemarie inspires him for the further achievements. Bud is dismissed. Now Bud works as a washer."
Camelot,"  Act I King Arthur is nervous about his upcoming arranged marriage and is hiding in a tree. Merlyn the Magician, his wise tutor, calls Arthur down to warn the young king that he must learn to think for himself. Merlyn, who lives backwards in time and remembers the future as well as the past, knows he will soon be separated from Arthur. Merlyn persuades Arthur to climb down and chides him for his unkingly behavior. Arthur then left alone, ponders both his subjects and his own feelings about the intended nuptials (""I Wonder What the King is Doing Tonight?""). Arthur hears someone coming and scampers up the tree again. Guenevere, Arthur's intended bride, comes to the woods. She does not like the idea of being Queen, preferring to live an ordinary life- at least, an ordinary rich life- (""Simple Joys of Maidenhood""). She stumbles into Arthur, who initially calls himself ""Wart"" (his childhood nickname) and then, hearing of her reluctance to marry, tells her of the joys of life in Camelot (""Camelot""). It is love at first sight, and they almost kiss, but are interrupted when Arthur's attendants come upon the two of them. He is revealed as the King. He tells Guenevere the story of how he pulled the sword from the stone and became king, and she finally agrees to marry him. The wizard Merlyn is amused by this development, but his joy turns to sorrow as his memories of the future begin to fade. He realizes that Nimue, a beautiful water nymph, has come to draw him into her cave for an eternal sleep (""Follow Me""). He begs Nimue for answers, as he has forgotten if he has warned Arthur about two important individuals, Lancelot and Mordred. His memories fade permanently, though, and he is led away.Five years later, Arthur sits with Guenevere in his study, debating about what to do. He explains that he wishes to create a new kind of knight — one that does not pillage and fight, but tries to uphold honor and justice. He is eventually inspired, with Guenevere's help, to establish the Round Table with the motto ""might for right."" Another five years pass.  Arthur's idea has led to the Knights of the Round Table being renowned all over the country, and their fame has even spread to France. A young, pretentious and over-religious Frenchman from Joyous Garde named Lancelot du Lac has heard of the Round Table, and is determined to come to Camelot and join Arthur's knights, confident that he is perfect for the post (""C'est Moi""). King Pellinore, an elderly man who was a friend of Arthur's family, also comes to Camelot to witness Arthur's greatness for himself, and it later seems that he has become part of the family. Guenevere organizes a May Day festival on the castle grounds (""The Lusty Month of May""), where Arthur introduces his wife to Lancelot. Guenevere takes an instant dislike to Lancelot. Time passes, and he makes an enemy of most of the knights. Guenevere incites three of them — Sir Dinadan, Sir Sagramore and the burly Sir Lionel — to challenge him to a joust (""Then You May Take Me to the Fair""). Arthur (who, unlike everybody else, is friendly with Lancelot) is dismayed by this, and is at a loss to understand a woman's way — though he cannot be angry with Guenevere (""How to Handle a Woman"").In the jousting match Lancelot easily defeats all three knights. He wounds Sir Lionel, who fights him last, so badly that the crowd thinks he is dead. But the dismay of the crowd turns to awe as Lancelot's distraught cries for Sir Lionel to live seemingly resurrect a dead man. Reflecting the adoration of the crowd, Guenevere finds herself falling in love with Lancelot. She does not wish to violate her marriage vows, however, and wishes Lancelot would leave Camelot (""Before I Gaze at You Again""). By some unfortunate twist of fate, Lancelot, in spite of his boasts that he is immune to pleasures of the flesh, is also madly in love with Guenevere, and is similarly torn by the conflict between this love and his devotion to Arthur. Arthur makes Lancelot a Knight of the Round Table. As it happens, the shrewd King Arthur guesses that Lancelot and Guenevere have feelings for each other, but hopes it will blow over, as he does not wish to upset the tranquility of Camelot. He soliloquizes to his sword Excalibur, that they will rise to the challenges they will all face, together. Act II Many years later, Guenevere and Lancelot are still tormented by their unfulfilled love. She tries to get rid of him, but Lancelot will not leave her (""If Ever I Would Leave You""). They both believe that Arthur is not aware of it. Nevertheless, she remains faithful to Arthur, and helps him in carrying out the affairs of State.Mordred, Arthur's illegitimate son, comes to Camelot to dishonor the King and tries to gain the throne for himself. Arthur puts him in charge of the knights’ training program, not knowing that Mordred is there to destroy the Round Table in revenge against Arthur for abandoning him, and detests the idea of being a Knight (""The Seven Deadly Virtues""). Arthur begins to feel the strain of ruling England, and both he and Guenevere wonder what commoners do without any such responsibilities (""What Do The Simple Folk Do?""). Mordred, meanwhile, has devised a plan to ruin Arthur and his kingdom permanently. He enters an enchanted glade where his aunt, the sorceress Morgan le Fay, dwells in an invisible castle. Morgan has a sweet tooth, and though she likes Arthur, Mordred manages to bribe her with a large supply of sweetmeats, to build one of her invisible walls around Arthur for one night, so that when he goes on his hunting trip the next day, he will not be able to get back to the castle (""The Persuasion"").  Meanwhile, Mordred incites the Knights to remember their former days of fighting and pillaging, and turns them against Arthur (""Fie On Goodness!"").  With Arthur gone, Lancelot, unable to stop himself, visits Guenevere in her chambers, as Mordred fully suspected he would.  They kiss passionately (""I Loved You Once in Silence""). However, Lancelot and Guenevere's affair and Mordred's machinations come to a head when Mordred and some of the Knights of the Round Table interrupt, accuse Lancelot of treason, and try to take him prisoner. Lancelot fights them off and escapes, but Guenevere is arrested, tried, found guilty of treason by reason of her infidelity, and sentenced to be burned at the stake (""Guenevere""). At the execution, Arthur watches from a distance as Mordred taunts him for his failures; he is torn between upholding his law and doing his duty as a king, or sparing Guenevere, whom he still loves in spite of everything. At the last moment, Lancelot arrives with an army, rescues Guenevere and takes her off with him to France. But in the process, Lancelot has been forced to kill some of the other knights, leaving the survivors vowing revenge.For the sake of his own honor and that of Camelot, Arthur must now wage war against Lancelot. Mordred has taken up his own army against Arthur, back in England. The war takes a terrible toll on Camelot, as more than half of the Knights of the Round Table are killed. Before the final battle, Arthur meets Lancelot and Guenevere. Lancelot and Guenevere's relationship has floundered, doubtless because of their guilty consciences. Guenevere has become a nun, and the Round Table is now broken. They offer to face up to justice in England, but Arthur will not see Guenevere burned or Lancelot beheaded. He forgives them both, and they depart separately. That night in camp, Arthur meets a young stowaway named Tom of Warwick, who has come to join the Round Table. His speech reminds Arthur of the idealism and hope that he had as a young king, and inspires him. Arthur knights Tom, and sends him back to England to grow up there, that he might pass on to future generations the ideals of chivalry and Camelot (""Camelot"" (reprise)).","King Arthur is very afraid of the upcoming wedding and did not want it, hiding in a tree. His wise mentor and advisor Merlyn the Magician tells him to start acting like a king and to think wisely. Merlyn exclusive feature is the fact that he lives in time backwards, so he remembers the future, and therefore his advices always reach the goal.  King Arthur suddenly meets his future wife, with whom he has appointed wedding, in the woods. They fall in love at first sight and in the course of conversation they almost kiss, but are interrupted by one of the servants of the King. His wife until this moment did not know that he is the king and now he admits how he has become one – he drew the sword Excalibur out of the stone. Then we see Merlin, who, turns out, loses his power to foresee the future and refers the matter to one of his acquaintances, water nymphs. She lures Merlin to eternal sleep in her cave and now his memory fades, and all fades…  After 10 years, King creates a new institution, the Round Table, which should unite under its wings not only knights who fight constantly, but which are useful for the society and defend the honor. When the Order was created, a lot of knights have been adopted in it all over England, and the glory of it comes to France. From France to Camelot goes ambitious young Lancelot, who became friends with the king, but will be an enemy for a variety of knights of the Table.  Arthur's wife arranges a tournament between the best knights. Arthur easily defeats all the knights and Lancelot is named a member of the Table, while the wife of Arthur falls in love with Lancelot. He loves her unconsciously, but is torn between loyalty to Arthur and temptation. This continues for several years, but the woman remains faithful to her husband, even though he guessed about her affair with Lance.  Illegitimate son of Arthur arrives at Camelot, to destroy the Kingdom and drop the King, in revenge for the fact that he was thrown away when born. During the departure of Arthur hunting, Lancelot and Arthur's wife cannot stand and kiss, but the son sees it, who, along with other knights, who do not like Lancelot, grabs him and her, but Lancelot manages to break free and escape. Arthur's wife is sentenced to death in the burning fire for the governmental treason, but in the last minute, Lancelot arrives with reinforcements and rescues her, taking her with him to France.  They war each other, during which killed a bigger part of Round Table. Meeting with Lancelot and Guenevere before the big final battle, Arthur learns that their relationship fell apart because of the feelings of betrayal of Arthur. He forgives them, and they both depart separately, and the war ends."
Hedwig and the Angry Inch," The concept of the stage production is that the audience is watching genderqueer rock singer Hedwig Robinson's musical act as she follows rockstar Tommy Gnosis' (much more successful) tour around the country. Occasionally Hedwig opens a door onstage to listen to Gnosis's concert, which is playing in an adjoining venue. Gnosis is recovering from an incident that nearly ruined his career, having crashed his car into a school bus while high and receiving oral sex from none other than Hedwig. Capitalizing on her notoriety from the incident, Hedwig determines to tell the audience her story (""Tear Me Down"").She is aided and hindered by her assistant, back-up singer and husband, Yitzhak. A Jewish drag queen from Zagreb, Yitzhak has an unhealthy, codependent relationship with Hedwig. Hedwig verbally abuses him throughout the evening, and it becomes clear that she is threatened by his natural talent, which eclipses her own. She describes how she agreed to marry him only after extracting a promise from him to never perform as a woman again, and he bitterly resents her treatment of him. (To further the musical's theme of blurred gender lines, Yitzhak is played by a female actress.)Hedwig tells her life story, which began when she was Hansel Schmidt, a  ""slip of a girlyboy"" growing up in East Berlin. Raised by an emotionally distant single mother after her father, an American soldier, abandoned the family, Hansel takes solace in her love of western rock music. She becomes fascinated with a story called  ""The Origin of Love"", based on Aristophanes' speech in Plato's Symposium. It explains that three sexes of human beings once existed: ""children of the Sun"" (man and man attached), ""children of the Earth"" (woman and woman attached), and ""children of the Moon"" (man and woman attached). Each were once round, two-headed, four-armed, and four-legged beings. Angry gods split these early humans in two, leaving the separated people with a lifelong yearning for their other half.  Hansel is determined to search for her other half, but is convinced she will have to travel to the West to do so.This becomes possible when, in her 20s, she meets Luther Robinson, an American soldier (""Sugar Daddy"") who convinces her to begin dressing in drag. Luther falls in love with Hansel and the two decide to marry. This plan will allow Hansel to leave communist East Germany for the capitalist West. However, in order to be married, the couple must consist of a man and a woman. Hansel's mother, Hedwig, gives Hansel her name and passport and finds a doctor to perform a sex change. However, the operation is botched, and Hansel's surgically constructed vagina heals closed, leaving Hedwig with a dysfunctional one-inch mound of flesh between her legs, ""with a scar running down it like a sideways grimace on an eyeless face"" (""Angry Inch"").Hedwig goes to live in Junction City, Kansas, as Luther's wife. On their first wedding anniversary, Luther leaves Hedwig for a man. That same day, it is announced that the Berlin Wall has fallen and Germany will reunite, meaning Hedwig's sacrifice was for nothing. Hedwig recovers from the separation by creating a more glamorous, feminine identity for herself (""Wig in a Box"") and forming a rock band she calls The Angry Inch.Hedwig befriends the brother of a child she babysits, shy and misunderstood Christian teenager Tommy Speck, who is fascinated by a song she writes with him in mind (""Wicked Little Town"").  They collaborate on songs and begin a relationship. Their songs are a success, and Hedwig gives him the stage name ""Tommy Gnosis."" Hedwig believes that Tommy is her soulmate and that she cannot be whole without him, but he is disgusted when he discovers that she is not biologically female and abandons her (""The Long Grift""). He goes on to become a wildly successful rock star with the songs Hedwig wrote alone and with him. The ""internationally ignored"" Hedwig and her band the Angry Inch are forced to support themselves by playing coffee bars and dives.Hedwig grows more erratic and unstable as the evening progresses, until she finally breaks down, stripping off her wig, dress, and make-up, forcing Yitzhak to step forward and sing (""Hedwig's Lament""/""Exquisite Corpse""). At the height of her breakdown, she seems to transform into Tommy Gnosis, who both begs for and offers forgiveness in a reprise of the song she wrote for him (""Wicked Little Town (Reprise)""). Hedwig, out of costume, finds acceptance within herself, giving her wig to Yitzhak. At peace, Hedwig departs the stage as Yitzhak takes over her final song, dressed fabulously in drag (""Midnight Radio"").","The story is focused on Hedwig (Hansel), who pursues a successful rock star Tommie. At the beginning, she tells about her husband and offends him. It becomes clear to the audience that she has a complex, because his talent eclipses her own. Then a viewer learns about the accident with Hedwig and Tommie and sees their story.  Hansel is a teenager with difficult gender identity, who was born in the East Germany. He reads philosophical books & listens to the rock music. A guy dreams to move to the West of his country. He wants to continue own life within the Capitalist world. When he is 26 years old, he meets American soldier. They lose their hearts from each other. The men decide to get married. It will allow the guy to leave communistic East Germany and to fulfill his dream. However, a couple should consist of people with different genders to get married, according to the existing law. His mother helps the son to change a name, makes him a passport & finds the doctor, who carries out an operation on a gender change. The surgeon intervention goes unsuccessfully, having left our fellow (known as Hedwig or Jadwiga) with a centimetric shoot between his legs — ""ill-fated inch"" that, however, hasn't prevented him from marriage.  During the first wedding anniversary, Hedwig learns that her husband leaves her for the other man. On the same day, she hears about the reunion of Germany and understands that the victim was in vain. She decides to get it together and create a female glamourous image. Hedwig wants to create a rock group. Hedwig works as a nurse. She becomes close to the brother of the child, whom she takes care of. They write songs, which make a big success. Hedwig is sure that Tommie is her faithful and understanding friend. However, the teenager gets disgusted, when he learns that Hedwig is not a girl since birth. He leaves her and creates his own band, which plays the songs written by him and Hedwig.  At this time, Hedwig earns money for a life singing in bars and cafes. She becomes more defiant and emotional. By the end of evening, she doesn't maintain and breaks from herself a wig with clothes and erases cosmetics. She sings the song like she is Tommie and apologizes to him."
Come from Away," On the morning of September 11, 2001, the townsfolk of Gander (including Claude the mayor, Oz the police constable, Beulah the teacher, Bonnie the SPCA worker and others) describe life in Newfoundland and how they learn of the terrorist attacks taking place in New York City, Washington, D.C., and Shanksville, Pennsylvania (""Welcome to the Rock"").The attacks result in US airspace being closed, forcing 38 international aircraft to be diverted and land unexpectedly at the Gander airport, doubling the population of the small Newfoundland town, which is unequipped for the influx of stranded travelers (""38 Planes""). The Gander townspeople spring to action and prepare to house, feed, clothe and comfort the nearly 7,000 passengers (along with 19 animals in cargo) (""Blankets and Bedding""). Meanwhile, the pilots, flight attendants and passengers are initially not permitted to leave the planes, forcing them to deal with confusing and conflicting information about what has happened and why they were suddenly grounded (""28 Hours / Wherever We Are"").Once allowed off the planes and transferred to various emergency shelters in and around Gander (""Darkness and Trees""), the passengers and crew watch replays of the attacks on the news and learn the true reason why they were grounded (""Lead Us Out of the Night""). The frightened and lonely passengers desperately try to contact their families and pray for their loved ones, while the townsfolk work through the night to help them in any and every way they can (""Phoning Home / Costume Party""). The travelers are initially taken aback by their hosts' uncommon hospitality, but they slowly let their guards down and begin to bond with the quirky townsfolk and each other. The ""islanders"" in Gander and the surrounding towns open up their homes to the ""plane people"", regardless of their guests' race, nationality or sexual orientation.  Two women, Beulah (from Gander) and Hannah (from New York), bond over the fact that both of their sons are firefighters, but Hannah's son is missing (""I Am Here""). Hannah asks Beulah to take her to a Catholic church, and a number of characters make their way to other houses of worship around town (""Prayer"").To alleviate rising fear and mounting tensions (""On The Edge""), the passengers are invited to be initiated as honorary Newfoundlanders at the local bar (""Heave Away / Screech In""). The gravity of the attacks nevertheless continues to set in as US airspace is eventually reopened. One trailblazing pilot, Beverley Bass, comments on how her once optimistic view of the world has suddenly changed (""Me and the Sky""). While one pair of passengers starts to develop a romance despite the terrible thing that brought them together (""Stop the World""), another pair sees their long-term relationship fall apart under the stress of the event.As the passengers and crew fly away to their homes, they joyously exchange stories of the immense kindness and generosity that was shown to them by the Newfoundland strangers in their time of need (""Somewhere in the Middle of Nowhere""), but not before a Muslim traveler, faced with increasing prejudice from his fellow passengers, undergoes a humiliating strip search prior to boarding. The townsfolk in Gander return to normal life, but comment on how empty their town now seems and how different the world now feels.  The passengers and airline staff who return to the United States are faced with the horror of the attacks' aftermath—including Hannah, who learns that her firefighter son lost his life during the rescue efforts. (""Something's Missing"").Ten years later, the crew and passengers (the ""come from away"") of the once stranded planes reunite in Gander, this time by choice, to celebrate the lifelong friendships and strong connections they formed in spite of the terrorist attacks (""Finale""). As Claude the mayor professes, ""Tonight we honour what was lost, but we also commemorate what we found.""","Fresh off sold-out runs in Seattle and San Diego, the new musical “Come From Away” tells the heart-warming true story of how a small Canadian town cared for 6,579 airline passengers stranded there on 9/11. When 38 planes were diverted to its doorstep, the town of Gander doubled in size, playing host to an international community of strangers and offering food, shelter and friendship. Featuring a rousing score of folk and rock, “Come From Away” honors the better angels of our nature, revealing hope and humanity in a time of darkness. The production marks the Ford’s debut of Tony Award-nominated director Christopher Ashley. See this hit musical prior to its Broadway engagement!"
Show Boat," Note: Although the basic plot of Show Boat has always remained the same, over the years revisions and alterations were made by the creators, and over time by subsequent producers and directors. Some of these revisions were for length and some for convenience, as when a different actor played a certain role and was unable to perform a specialty piece written for the role's creator. Some have been made to reflect contemporary sensitivities toward race, gender and other social issues.Act IIn 1887, the show boat Cotton Blossom arrives at the river dock in Natchez, Mississippi. The Reconstruction era had ended a decade earlier, and white-dominated Southern legislatures have imposed racial segregation and Jim Crow rules. The boat's owner, Cap'n Andy Hawks, introduces his actors to the crowd on the levee.  A fistfight breaks out between Steve Baker, the leading man of the troupe, and Pete, a rough engineer who had been making passes at Steve's wife, the leading lady Julie La Verne. Steve knocks Pete down, and Pete swears revenge, suggesting he knows a dark secret about Julie. Cap'n Andy pretends to the shocked crowd that the fight was a preview of one of the melodramas to be performed. The troupe exits with the showboat band, and the crowd follows.A handsome riverboat gambler, Gaylord Ravenal, appears on the levee and is taken with eighteen-year-old Magnolia (""Nolie"") Hawks, an aspiring performer and the daughter of Cap'n Andy and his wife Parthenia Ann (Parthy). Magnolia is likewise smitten with Ravenal (""Make Believe""). She seeks advice from Joe, a black dock worker aboard the boat, who has returned from buying flour for his wife Queenie, the ship's cook. He replies that there are ""lots like [Ravenal] on the river."" As Magnolia goes inside the boat to tell her friend Julie about the handsome stranger, Joe mutters that she ought to ask the river for advice. He and the other dock workers reflect on the wisdom and indifference of ""Ol' Man River"", who doesn't seem to care what the world's troubles are, but ""jes' keeps rollin' along"".Magnolia finds Julie inside and announces that she's in love. Julie cautions her that this stranger could be just a ""no-account river fellow"". Magnolia says that if she found out he was ""no-account"", she'd stop loving him. Julie warns her that it's not that easy to stop loving someone, explaining that she'll always love Steve, singing a few lines of ""Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man"". Queenie overhears – she is surprised that Julie knows that song as she has only heard ""colored folks"" sing it. Magnolia remarks that Julie sings it all the time, and when Queenie asks if she can sing the entire song, Julie obliges.During the rehearsal for that evening, Julie and Steve learn that the town sheriff is coming to arrest them. Steve takes out a large pocket knife and makes a cut on the back of her hand, sucking the blood and swallowing it. Pete returns with the sheriff, who insists the show cannot proceed because Julie is a mulatto who has been passing as white and local law prohibits mixed marriages. Julie admits that her mother was black, but Steve tells the sheriff that he also has ""black blood"" in him, so their marriage is legal in Mississippi. The troupe backs him up, boosted by the ship's pilot Windy McClain, a longtime friend of the sheriff. The couple have escaped the charge of miscegenation, but they still have to leave the show boat; identified as black, they can no longer perform for the segregated white audience. Cap'n Andy fires Pete, but in spite of his sympathy for Julie and Steve, he cannot violate the law for them.Ravenal returns and asks for passage on the boat. Andy hires him as the new leading man and assigns his daughter Magnolia as the new leading lady, over her mother's objections. As Magnolia and Ravenal begin to rehearse their roles and in the process, kiss for the first time (infuriating Parthy), Joe reprises the last few lines of ""Ol' Man River"".Weeks later, Magnolia and Ravenal have been a hit with the crowds and have fallen in love. As the levee workers hum ""Ol' Man River"" in the background, he proposes to Magnolia, and she accepts. The couple joyously sings ""You Are Love"". They make plans to marry the next day while Parthy, who disapproves, is out of town. Parthy has discovered that Ravenal once killed a man and arrives with the Sheriff to interrupt the wedding festivities. The group learns that Ravenal was acquitted of murder. Cap'n Andy calls Parthy ""narrow-minded"" and defends Ravenal by announcing that he also once killed a man. Parthy faints, but the ceremony proceeds.Act IISix years have passed, and it is 1893. Ravenal and Magnolia have moved to Chicago, where they make a precarious living from Ravenal's gambling. At first they are rich and enjoying the good life (""Why Do I Love You?"") By 1903, they have a daughter, Kim, and after years of varying income, they are broke and rent a room in a boarding house. Depressed over his inability to support his family, Ravenal abandons Magnolia and Kim.  Frank and Ellie, two former actors from the showboat, learn that Magnolia is living in the rooms they want to rent. The old friends seek a singing job for Magnolia at the Trocadero, the club where they are doing a New Year's show. Julie is working there. She has fallen into drinking after having been abandoned by Steve. At a rehearsal, she tries out the new song ""Bill."" She appears to be thinking of Steve and sings it with great emotion. From her dressing-room, she hears Magnolia singing ""Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man"" for her audition, the song which Julie taught her years ago. Julie secretly quits her job so that Magnolia can fill it, without learning of her sacrifice.Ravenal visits his daughter Kim at the convent where she goes to school to say goodbye before leaving her forever (""Make Believe"" (reprise)). On New Year's Eve, Andy and Parthy go to Chicago for a surprise visit to their daughter Magnolia. He goes to the Trocadero without his wife, and sees Magnolia overcome with emotion and nearly booed off stage. Andy rallies the crowd by starting a sing-along of the standard, ""After the Ball"". Magnolia becomes a great musical star.More than 20 years pass, and it is 1927. An aged Joe on the Cotton Blossom sings a reprise of ""Ol' Man River"". Cap'n Andy has a chance meeting with Ravenal and arranges his reunion with Magnolia. Andy knows that Magnolia is retiring and returning to the Cotton Blossom with Kim, who has become a Broadway star. Kim gives her admirers a taste of her performing abilities by singing an updated, Charleston version of ""Why Do I Love You?"" Ravenal sings a reprise of ""You Are Love"" to the offstage Magnolia. Although he is uncertain about asking her to take him back, Magnolia, who has never stopped loving him, greets him warmly and does. As the happy couple walks up the boat's gangplank, Joe and the cast sing the last verse of ""Ol' Man River"".Plot variants in 1951 filmThe 1951 MGM film changed the final scenes of the story, as well as many small details. It reconciles Ravenal and Magnolia a few years after they separate, rather than 23. When Ravenal leaves Magnolia in Chicago, she is pregnant.  By a chance meeting with Julie, Ravenal learns that Magnolia gave birth to his daughter. He returns to her and sees the child Kim playing. Magnolia sees them together and takes him back, and the family returns to the show boat. Joe and the chorus start singing ""Ol' Man River"" as the scenes unfold, then the paddlewheel starts turning in tempo with the music, as the ship heads down river. Julie is shown, viewing from a distance. She had watched the scene from the shadows.","Musical’s actions occur on a riverboat, which for many years is floating on the river Mississippi.

42nd Street," Act IAuditions for 1933's newest show, Pretty Lady, are nearly over when Peggy Sawyer, fresh off the bus from Allentown, Pennsylvania, arrives in New York City with valise in hand. Billy Lawlor, already cast as one of the juvenile leads, notices her and hopes to charm her into accepting a date with him (""Young and Healthy""). He informs her she has missed the audition but he can help her bypass that process, but choreographer Andy Lee has no time for Billy's latest conquest and tells her, ""Amscray, toots."" Embarrassed and flustered, she rushes off, only to run into director Julian Marsh.One-time star Dorothy Brock, indignant at being asked to audition for a role, is reassured by Bert that he merely wants to make sure the songs are in her key (""Shadow Waltz""). Despite his feeling she is a prima donna past her prime, he agrees to cast her in order to get financial backing from her wealthy beau, Abner Dillon. Outside the theatre, writer Maggie and chorus girls Anytime Annie, Phyllis, and Lorraine take pity on Peggy and invite her to join them for lunch and some advice. They encourage her to show them a dance routine that is witnessed by Julian, who decides there might be room for one more chorus girl after all (""Go Into Your Dance"").Dorothy and Billy rehearse a kissing scene, but Abner refuses to put money into a show where he has to watch Dorothy kiss someone else. The kiss is removed from ""Pretty Lady"" (""You're Getting to be a Habit With Me"").Peggy faints and is taken to Dorothy's dressing room. Pat is there and tries to help her. Dorothy finds them there together and assumes they are having an affair. She blows up at them. Julian overhears the argument and fears that Abner will take away funding for the show. He decides to put an end to the affair. A phone call to an unsavory acquaintance brings Pat a visit from a couple of thugs who convince him to break it off with her. The show's cast then departs to Arch Street Theatre in Philadelphia, for the out-of-town tryout (""Getting Out of Town"").The scenery and costumes will not arrive on time, but the cast begins their dress rehearsal regardless (""Dames"").A party is planned. Peggy asks Julian if he will be attending. He decides to go because he is attracted to Peggy (""I Only Have Eyes For You"").Dorothy is at the party and is drunk. She misses Pat, and she tells Abner she was only with him because of his money. She breaks it off with him. Abner wants to close the show, but he is convinced to keep it running. Dorothy finds Pat, but he is once again driven off by Julian at the hands of the gangsters. Peggy tries to warn Pat, and Dorothy catches them together, which makes her upset (""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"").""Pretty Lady"" finally opens (""We're in the Money""), but someone bumps into Peggy, which causes her to knock over Dorothy. Dorothy cannot get up. This makes Julian angry. He fires Peggy immediately, and tells the audience that the show is canceled.Act IIDorothy's ankle is broken, and the show may close, but the chorus kids will not give up (""Sunny Side to Every Situation""). The chorus kids, certain Peggy could fill the lead role, find Julian and tell him that she's a fresh young face who can sing and dance circles around Dorothy. He decides it is worth a shot and rushes off to the train station to catch her before she departs.At Philadelphia's Broad Street Station, Julian apologizes to Peggy and asks her to stay and star in the show, but she responds that she has had enough of show business and wants to go home to Allentown. Dumbfounded, he tries to coax her with the words ""Come on along and listen to the lullaby of Broadway..."" After the cast joins him in the serenade, she decides to accept his offer (""Lullaby of Broadway"").Forced to learn the part in two days, Peggy is on the verge of a nervous breakdown when she has an unexpected visit from Dorothy, who has been watching the rehearsals and realizes that beneath her nervous exterior, Peggy is good, ""maybe even better than I would have been."" She even offers a little friendly advice on how to perform the last song, ""About a Quarter to Nine.""It's time for the curtain to rise again (""Shuffle Off to Buffalo""). The opening night curtain is about to rise when Julian, who is completely in love with Peggy at this point, stops by for a last minute lip-lock and pep talk in which he utters the now iconic line, ""You're going out there a youngster, but you've got to come back a star!"" The show is a huge success sure to catapult her into stardom (""42nd Street""). In addition, even though she is invited to and expected to attend the official opening night party, she decides to go to the chorus one instead. Julian is left alone onstage with only a single ghost light casting his huge shadow on the back wall. He quietly begins to sing, ""Come and meet those dancing feet on the avenue I'm taking you to...42nd Street"" (""42nd Street (Reprise)"").","Auditions of the actors for a new musical ‘Pretty Lady’ started in New York. The cast of performers was already finished when Peggy Sawyer appeared on the scene. Provincial girl so worried that was late to the casting. Her arrival was noticed by Billy Lawlor – leading actor of performance. A girl made a great impression on him. Hoping for a possible relationship in the future, he decided to help Peggy with this audition. Despite her beautiful voice, director Julian Marsh refused to deal with the latecomer actress. Upset girl ran away, forgetting her purse on the piano. The author of the musical Maggie stated that she would come back. Soon to the theater came diva Dorothy Brock and her patron Abner Dillon – he invested in this musical 100 thousand dollars for the sake of his beloved. When he learned that the actress was also required to pass the audition, the rich man became angry. The creators of the musical convinced diva – it was necessary for the show. After Dorothy started the rehearsal, she met actor Pat Denning. They were romantically tied, until she went to Abner Dillon.  When Peggy Sawyer came in the theater, Maggie invited her to have a dinner with her and three other chorus girls. Actresses showed provincial girl dance movements that they performed, and she repeated them with ease. Choreographer appreciated Peggy’s abilities high, as well as the director, who was passing by. As Julian needed another chorus girl, he invited the talented provincial girl in the corps de ballet. During another rehearsal, girl fainted from hunger, and she was carried to the dressing room of Dorothy. Expected there for diva, Pat Denning started to turn Peggy to senses. Seeing this scene, Brock was very angry. The director realized – Dorothy still loved the actor. Realizing that the musical’s funding may cease, Marsh asked bandits he knew to affect Pat. After threats, actor went to Philadelphia. He did not know that the regional premiere was shifted to this state.  During the party before the show, intoxicated Dorothy admitted Abner Dillon she was with him only because of the money and now she abandons him. Frustrated rich fellow was persuaded with difficulty not to interrupt the funding of the musical. Director once again decided to get rid of Pat using gangsters’ hands. Overhearing the conversation of Marsh, Peggy tried to warn Dorothy. In the dressing room of diva, girl met Pat, and again leading actress caught them together. During the premiere, there was an accident – someone pushed Peggy, and she ran onto Brock, knocking her to the ground. Because of this, a girl was fired. It turned out that diva’s broken ankle would not allow to finish the show. The director wanted to cancel further shows, but performers persuaded him to make a replacement of the lead actress. They barely had time to return Peggy back, who was about to leave home.  After 36 hours, in New York there must be the premiere. During this time, provincial girl had to learn her part, including a large amount of lyrics, dances and songs. Being in a high voltage, a girl was visited by diva. Dorothy thanked Peggy – because of her injury, she realized whom she loved for real. The actress has married Pat Denning. The woman tipped a girl how to behave on stage the best. Premiere on Broadway was a huge success – the audience liked the talented newcomer very much. After the spectacle, Peggy went not to a grand reception at The Ritz, but at a modest party of actors, inviting the happy director to join them."
Man of La Mancha," In the late sixteenth century, failed author-soldier-actor and tax collector Miguel de Cervantes has been thrown into a dungeon by the Spanish Inquisition, along with his manservant. They have been charged with foreclosing on a monastery. Their fellow prisoners attack them, eager to steal the contents of the large trunk Cervantes has brought with him. However, a sympathetic criminal known as ""the Governor"" suggests setting up a mock trial instead. Only if Cervantes is found guilty will he have to hand over his possessions. A cynical prisoner, known as ""the Duke,"" charges Cervantes with being an idealist and a bad poet. Cervantes pleads guilty, but then asks if he may offer a defense, in the form of a play, acted out by him and all the prisoners. The ""Governor"" agrees.Cervantes takes out a makeup kit and costume from his trunk, and transforms himself into Alonso Quijano, an old gentleman who has read so many books of chivalry and thought so much about injustice that he has lost his mind and set out as a knight-errant. Quijano renames himself Don Quixote de La Mancha, and goes off to find adventures with his ""squire"", Sancho Panza. (""Man of La Mancha (I, Don Quixote)"")Don Quixote warns Sancho that they are always in danger of being attacked by Quixote's mortal enemy, an evil magician known as the Enchanter. Suddenly he spots a windmill, mistakes it for a four-armed giant, attacks it, and receives a beating from the encounter. Quixote decides that he lost the battle because he was never properly knighted. He then mistakes a rundown inn for a castle and orders Sancho to announce their arrival by blowing his bugle.Cervantes talks some prisoners into assuming the roles of the inn's serving wench and part-time prostitute Aldonza, and a group of muleteers who are propositioning her. Aldonza fends them off sarcastically (""It's All The Same""), but eventually deigns to accept their leader, Pedro, who pays in advance.Don Quixote enters with Sancho, asking for the lord of the castle. The Innkeeper (played by The Governor) humors Don Quixote as best he can. Quixote sees Aldonza and declares that she is his lady, Dulcinea, to whom he has sworn eternal loyalty (""Dulcinea""). Aldonza, used to rough treatment, is first flabbergasted and then annoyed at Quixote's kindness, and is further aggravated when the Muleteers turn Quixote's tender ballad into a mocking serenade.Meanwhile, Antonia, Don Quixote's niece, has gone with Quixote's housekeeper to seek advice from the local priest, who realizes that the two women are more concerned with the embarrassment Quixote's madness may bring them than with his actual welfare (""I'm Only Thinking of Him"").Cervantes chooses ""the Duke"" to play Dr. Sanson Carrasco, Antonia's fiancé, a man just as cynical and self-centered as the prisoner who is playing him. Carrasco is upset at the idea of marrying into the family of a madman, but the priest convinces Carrasco that it would be a worthy challenge to use his abilities to cure his prospective uncle-in-law. Carrasco and the priest set out to bring Don Quixote back home (""I'm Only Thinking of Him [Reprise]"").Back at the inn, Sancho delivers a missive from Don Quixote to Aldonza courting her favor and asking for a token of her esteem. Aldonza provides the requested token: an old dishrag. She asks Sancho why he follows Quixote, but he can come up with no explanation other than ""I Really Like Him"". Alone, Aldonza ponders Quixote's behavior and her inability to laugh at him (""What Do You Want of Me?""). In the courtyard, the muleteers once again taunt Aldonza with a suggestive song (""Little Bird, Little Bird""). Pedro makes arrangements with her for an assignation later.The priest and Dr. Carrasco arrive, but cannot reason with Don Quixote. Quixote becomes distracted by a barber who passes by the inn, wearing his shaving basin on his head to ward off the sun's heat (""The Barber's Song""). Quixote threatens the barber with a sword and snatches the basin, declaring it is the ""Golden Helmet of Mambrino"", which makes its wearer invulnerable. Dr. Carrasco and the priest leave, with the priest impressed by Don Quixote's view of life and wondering if curing him is really worthwhile (""To Each His Dulcinea"").Quixote still wishes to be officially dubbed a knight: he plans to stand vigil all night over his armor in the inn's courtyard, and then have the Innkeeper (whom he mistakes for a nobleman) grant him knighthood the following morning. Aldonza encounters Quixote in the courtyard and confronts him; Quixote does his best to explain the ideals he follows and the quest he is on (""The Impossible Dream""). Pedro enters, furious at being kept waiting, and slaps Aldonza. Enraged, Don Quixote takes him and all the other muleteers on in a fight (""The Combat""). Don Quixote has no martial skill, but by luck and determination – and with the help of Aldonza and Sancho – he prevails, and the muleteers are all knocked unconscious. But the noise attracts the attention of the Innkeeper, who tells Quixote that he must leave. Quixote apologizes for the trouble but reminds the Innkeeper of his promise to dub him knight. The Innkeeper does so (""Knight of the Woeful Countenance"").Quixote then declares that he must comfort the wounded muleteers, because chivalry requires kindness to one's enemies. Aldonza, impressed, says that she will help the muleteers instead. But when she comes to them with bandages, they beat her, rape her, and carry her off (""The Abduction""). Quixote, unaware of this, contemplates his recent victory and new knighthood (""The Impossible Dream"" – first reprise).At this point, the Don Quixote play is brutally interrupted when the Inquisition enters the dungeon and drags off an unwilling prisoner to be tried.  The Duke taunts Cervantes for his look of fear, and accuses him of not facing reality. This prompts Cervantes to passionately defend his idealism.The Don Quixote play resumes (""Man of La Mancha"" – first reprise). Quixote and Sancho have left the inn and encounter a band of Gypsies (""Moorish Dance"") who take advantage of Quixote's naiveté and steal everything they own, including Quixote's horse Rocinante and Sancho's donkey Dapple. Quixote and Sancho are forced to return to the inn. Aldonza also shows up at the inn, bruised and ashamed. Quixote swears to avenge her, but she tells him off, flinging her real, pitiful history in his face and blaming him for allowing her a glimpse of a life she can never have. She begs him to see her as she really is but Quixote can only see her as his Dulcinea (""Aldonza"").Suddenly, another knight enters. He announces himself as Don Quixote's mortal enemy, the Enchanter, in the form of the ""Knight of the Mirrors"". He insults Aldonza, so Quixote challenges him to combat. The Knight of the Mirrors and his attendants bear huge mirrored shields, and as they swing them at Quixote (""Knight of the Mirrors""), the glare blinds him. The Knight taunts Quixote, forcing him to see himself as the world sees him: a fool and a madman. Don Quixote collapses, weeping. The Knight of the Mirrors removes his helmet – he is really Dr. Carrasco, returned with his latest plan to cure Quixote.Cervantes announces that the story is finished, but the prisoners are dissatisfied with the ending. They prepare to burn his manuscript when he asks for the chance to present one last scene. The governor agrees.Quixote is back at home, and has fallen into a coma. Sancho tries to cheer him up (""A Little Gossip""), and Alonso opens his eyes. He is now sane: he gives his name as Alonso Quijano and thinks his knightly career was just a dream. However, he feels close to death, and asks the priest to help him make out his will. Aldonza suddenly forces her way into the room. She has come to visit Quixote because she can no longer bear to be anyone but Dulcinea. When he does not recognize her, she sings a reprise of ""Dulcinea"" and tries to help him remember the words of ""The Impossible Dream."" Suddenly, he remembers everything and rises from his bed, calling for his armor and sword so that he may set out again (""Man of La Mancha"" – second reprise). But it is too late – in mid-song, he cries out and falls dead. The priest sings ""The Psalm"" (Psalm 130 in Latin) for the dead. Sancho is distraught at his friend's death. Aldonza tries to comfort him, saying that Alonso Quijano may be dead but Don Quixote lives on. When Sancho addresses her as Aldonza, she replies, ""My name is Dulcinea.""The Inquisition enters to take Cervantes to his trial, and the prisoners, finding him not guilty, return his manuscript. It is his (as yet) unfinished novel, Don Quixote. As Cervantes and his servant mount the staircase to go to their impending trial, the prisoners, led by the girl who played Dulcinea, sing ""The Impossible Dream"" in chorus.","Events of musical carry spectators to the 16th century in the Spanish city named Seville. Unlucky poet and tax collector Miguel de Cervantes go to jail for crimes against the Catholic Church. As it turned out, the main character has attempted to gather taxes not only from the common people, but also from the church, for which he was accused. Now Miguel is waiting for the so-called invitation to the court of the Inquisition. Nothing good, of course, it will bring.  Wanting the property of Cervantes, other prisoners organize their own tribunal. The role of the prosecutor in it receives colorful character named Duke – sarcastic and not believing in any big dream person. According to the laws of the process of the cell, if the main character is found guilty, he will be deprived of absolutely everything. The poet agrees with hesitation, but on condition that he will only obtain one manuscript. First, the leader of the prisoners opposes and attempts to burn the scroll. But Miguel manages to stop the rush of his rival. He asks to give him the opportunity to say a good final word. Cervantes offers a theatrical play that he will do with all prisoners. According to the main character, if it does not serve as an excuse, at least it will entertain all. Duke gives permission to proceed.  A little maked-up, Miguel begins to get used to the role. He explains that his character is Alonso Quijana – a well-read man, attracted much to books about knights. He imagines himself a knight who needs to go and perform a variety of feats. The main character changes his name to the more sonorous and noble Don Quixote de La Mancha and decides to go in search of the glory. He takes a faithful squire Sancho Panza with him – a man who knows, it would seem, all sayings and proverbs on the planet. His role is played by Miguel Cervantes. Knight along with his partner saddle horses, for which served things at hand and go on a long and dangerous journey.  The story contains many humorous and satirical elements. There also a classical love line, as well as a demonstration of this knightly valor. At the end of the play, all prisoners are delighted. Duke gives back to Cervantes his manuscript, saying that even though he understood little of spoken story, but he liked a mad knight. At this point, there came Inquisitors, who report to the protagonist that it is a time of the trial. Leader of prisoners gives advice Miguel to defend with the same vigor and zeal as he had done in front of them. Only doing so, the poet will be able to escape the fire. Going up along with his servant on a lifting bridge, Cervantes unexpectedly hears the song The Impossible Dream. Its performers are all prisoners who give a tribute to their new friend."
Sunday in the Park with George,"  Act I In 1884, Georges Seurat, known as George in the musical, is sketching studies for his painting A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte. He announces to the audience: ""White, a blank page or canvas. The challenge: bring order to the whole, through design, composition, tension, balance, light and harmony."" He conjures up the painting's setting, a small suburban park on an island, and retains some control of his surroundings as he draws them. His longtime mistress, Dot, models for him, despite her frustration at having to get up early on a Sunday (""Sunday in the Park with George""). More park regulars begin to arrive: a quarrelsome Old Lady and her Nurse discuss how Paris is changing to accommodate a tower for the International Exposition, but the Nurse is more interested in a German coachman, Franz. The quiet of the park is interrupted by a group of rude bathers. George freezes them with a gesture, making them the subjects of his first painting, Bathers at Asnières. The setting abruptly changes to a gallery where the painting is on display. Jules (a more successful artist friend of George's) and his wife Yvonne think George's work has ""No Life"". Back on the island, Jules and Yvonne have a short discussion with George and depart. They take their coachman Franz with them, interrupting his rendezvous with the Nurse. Dot, who has grown tired of standing still in the early morning sunlight, leaves the park mollified after George promises to take her to the Follies. George approaches the Old Lady, revealed to be his mother, and asks to draw her, but she bluntly refuses.In his studio George works on his painting obsessively while Dot prepares for their date and fantasizes about being a Follies girl (""Color and Light""). When George briefly stops painting to clean his brushes, he and Dot reflect on how fascinated they are by each other. Dot is ready to leave, but George chooses to continue painting instead, greatly upsetting her.In the park on a Sunday some time later, George sketches a disgruntled Boatman to the disapproval of an observing Jules. Dot enters on the arm of Louis, a baker. Two chatting shopgirls, both named Celeste, notice Dot with a new man (""Gossip""). When Jules and Yvonne's daughter Louise attempts to pet the Boatman's dog, he shouts at her, then lashes out at George and storms off. George and Dot have a strained conversation as she works on the grammar book she is using to teach herself how to read and write. As Jules and Yvonne mock the unconventional nature of George's art, they discuss an initiative to have his work included in the next group show, which they both protest. George sketches two dogs while whimsically trying to imagine the world from their perspective, describing their relief to be free of their routines on Sunday (""The Day Off""). As the day goes on, George quietly sketches denizens of the park: The two Celestes try to attract the attention of a pair of Soldiers, fighting over which will get the more handsome of the two; the Nurse hides from the Old Lady and attempts to attract Franz's attention; Franz and his wife Frieda argue with Louise and each other; a pair of wealthy American tourists pass by, hating everything about Paris but the pastries, and plan to return home with a baker in tow; Jules returns to further lecture George on his shortcomings as an artist, receiving in response an invitation to see his new painting; the Boatman reappears to rebuke artists' condescending attitude. Dot sees George, but he slips away before she can speak to him, and in retaliation she describes her satisfying new life with Louis. She clearly misses and loves George, but Louis loves, respects and needs her in a way George cannot, and she has made her choice (""Everybody Loves Louis"").As the park empties for the evening, George returns. He misses Dot and laments that his art has alienated him from those important to him, but resigns himself to the likelihood that creative fulfillment may always take precedence for him over personal happiness (""Finishing the Hat"").Time has passed, and a heavily pregnant Dot visits George's studio. She asks for a painting George made of her, but he refuses. Jules and Yvonne come to the studio to see George's nearly finished painting. While Jules goes with George to see the painting, Yvonne and Dot hold a wary conversation. They realize they have both felt neglected by an artist, their mutual dislike fades, and they discuss the difficulties of trying to maintain a romantic relationship with an artist. Meanwhile, Jules is puzzled by George's new technique and concerned that his obsession with his work is alienating him from his fellow artists and collectors alike. He refuses to support the work. Jules and Yvonne leave, and George, having forgotten Dot was there, goes back to work. Dot reveals the real reason for her visit: despite the obvious fact that George fathered her unborn child, she and Louis are getting married and leaving for America. George angrily retreats behind his canvas, and she begs him to react, in some way, to her news. They argue bitterly about their failed relationship, and Dot concludes sadly that while George may be capable of self-fulfillment, she is not, and they must part (""We Do Not Belong Together"").In the park the Old Lady finally agrees to sit for George, losing herself in fond memories of his childhood that George repeatedly disputes. She bemoans Paris's changing skyline, and he encourages her to see the beauty in the world as it is, rather than how it has been (""Beautiful""). The American Tourists arrive with Louis and Dot, who holds her newborn daughter, Marie. George refuses to acknowledge her or his child, able to offer only a feeble apology as Dot departs sadly.The park grows noisy: the Celestes and the Soldier argue over their respective breakups while Jules and Frieda sneak away to have a tryst. Louise informs Yvonne of her father's infidelity and a fight breaks out among Jules, Yvonne, Franz, and Frieda. The Celestes and the Soldier squabble noisily, and soon all the park-goers are fighting until the Old Lady shouts, ""Remember, George!"", and he stops them all with a gesture. George takes control of the subjects of his painting, who sing in harmony as he transforms them into the final tableau of his finished painting (""Sunday""). Act II As the curtain opens the characters – still in the tableau – complain about being stuck in the painting (""It's Hot Up Here""). The characters deliver short eulogies for George, who died suddenly at 31.The action fast-forwards a century to 1984. George and Dot's great-grandson, also an artist named George, is at a museum unveiling his latest work, a reflection on Seurat's painting in the form of a light machine called ""Chromolume #7"". George presents the work, grounding its connection to the painting by inviting his 98-year-old grandmother, Marie, to help him present the work. Marie shares her family history, describing how her mother, Dot, informed her on her deathbed that she was Seurat's daughter. George is skeptical of that bit of family lore, but Marie insists that the notes in Dot's grammar book, which mention George, are proof. After a brief technical failure, the Chromolume is unveiled.At the reception, various patrons and curators congratulate George on his work while George flits among them, commenting on the difficulties of producing modern art (""Putting It Together""). Like his great-grandfather, he conjures his surroundings, allowing himself to hold multiple conversations at once. The only voice he finds he cannot ignore is that of an art critic who advises him that he is repeating himself and wasting his gifts. After the museum's patrons have left for dinner, Marie speaks to her mother's image in the painting, worrying about George. When he arrives to take her home, she tells him about her mother, attempting to pass on a message about the legacy we leave behind (""Children and Art""). She dozes off and George, alone with the painting, realizes he is lacking connection.Weeks later, Marie has died and George has been invited by the French government to do a presentation of the Chromolume on the island the painting depicts. There George reveals to his friend Dennis that he has turned down his next commission. Feeling adrift and unsure, George reads from a book he inherited from his grandmother – the same one Dot used to learn to read – and ponders the similarities between himself and his great-grandfather (""Lesson #8""). A vision of Dot appears and greets George, whom she addresses as if he were the George she knew. He confides his doubts to her and she tells him to stop worrying about whether his choices are right and simply make them (""Move On""). George finds some words written in the back of the book – the words George often muttered while he worked. As George reads them aloud the characters from the painting fill the stage and recreate their tableau (""Sunday""). As they leave and the stage resembles a blank canvas, George reads: ""White: a blank page or canvas. His favorite – so many possibilities.""","The action of the musical unfolds in 1884, when on the banks of the river artisan named Georges Seurat, draws a picture. His beloved named Dot poses him, who is suffering from necessity to get up on early Sunday morning to be a muse for her beloved. She also suffers from lack of his attention, because he, as a true artist, fully immersed in his creativity, ignoring everything else. The park begins to be filled with people usually strolling here. Elderly ladies are very unhappy to the Eiffel Tower, which is now visible from any corner of he city. There also walks a couple of Jules (more successful artist than Georges) and his wife Yvonne. They do not share the artistic style of the main character.  Later the same day the artist promises his beloved that they will attend the performance, of which the girl was very happy. However, the clock is ticking, and the artist had forgotten about his promise. Angry about such obvious disregard, girl leaves the master but he didn’t even notice, being enthusiastically involved in his work.  The following Sunday, the artist once again is on the shore. He continues to paint his picture, as suddenly appears Dot with his new lover-baker. Georges is still immersed in his occupation, and his attention riveted to those who rests on the shore: two girls with the same name, the romping dog, boatman, an elderly lady and her sitter. The artist draws dog on his canvas and tries to see the world through its eyes. What do it feel, playing on the shore this morning?  Dot wants to speak with former beloved, but he eluded from her. In the new relationship, she feels love and care, which was not in her former life with the painter. By evening, the park gets empty and the painter returns in his gallery, complaining that art has caused the loss of all people close to him. But he is calmed down with the idea that only art is paramount. Dot comes some time later in the studio of the artist. She was pregnant by his kid, but she says that soon she will leave to America with a baker. The only her request is to have back that same painting that Georges drew on that Sunday morning. A girl is refused and a quarrel erupted. She complains that self-realization for the man is the most important thing on Earth.  The action again takes place in the park. The artist paints his picture again, he sees approaching Dot with a newborn baby in her arms. But the artist does not believe that a child is from him. In the park gets very noisy, vacationers quarrel, but by one hand movement, painter makes all turn to silence, emotions subside and submissive people occupy places prepared for them on the canvas.  The second act tells about events that happened exactly 100 years later. The exhibition presents a picture painted by Georges’ descendant, a representative of the modern art. In the presentation of painting he is helped by his grandmother, which reveals a family secret to the public – they are the descendants of the famous painter Georges Seurat, who died suddenly at 31 years old. To confirm her words, she shows to the public the grammar of the English language with French notes in the margins, left by her mother.  A few weeks later, the young artist arranges the presentation of the painting on the same island, where his ancestor wrote his famous painting. Suddenly out of the darkness comes a young woman. This is Dot. She mistook the man for her beloved and tells him not to pay attention to the words of the people, because only his vision is important, rather than assessment of everyone around. She thanks him for happy past. When the delusion passed, the young artist opened a grammar and clearly read the words of his famous ancestor: “The white clean sheet is a lot of opportunities”."
"You're a Good Man, Charlie Brown"," (1999 version)  Act I Charlie Brown stands alone as his friends give their various opinions of him, each overlapping the other. Today everyone is calling him a ""good man"". Charlie Brown is happy and hopeful as usual, but he nevertheless wonders if he really is what they say. He decides to find out how he can really become a good person (""Opening/You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown"").Alone one day, during lunch, Charlie Brown talks about his bad days. Then he notices the Little Red-Haired Girl and decides to go sit with her. However, he cannot find the courage to do so.Lucy expresses her deep infatuation with Schroeder and asks him what he thinks of the idea of marriage. Schroeder is aware of her feelings, but remains aloof as he plays his piano. Lucy then exclaims: ""My Aunt Marion was right. Never try to discuss marriage with a musician"" (""Schroeder""). Sally is sad because her jump rope tangled up.Snoopy is lying on top of his doghouse, relaxing vacantly and peacefully. He begins to daydream about being a wild jungle beast. In a few minutes, however, he is back to his peaceful state (""Snoopy""). Linus enters, holding his blanket and sucking his thumb. Lucy and Sally show up and mock him for this habit. Linus decides to abandon his blanket and move on, only to come running back to it in desperation. After the girls leave, Linus daydreams of a blanket fantasy where everyone can relax with their blankets (""My Blanket and Me""). Lucy later tells him that she would someday like to be a queen. However, Linus tells her that she can't and she threatens to punch him. Sally gets a D for her pathetic coat-hanger sculpture.Charlie Brown appears, trying to get his unusually stubborn kite to soar in the air. Eventually, he succeeds in doing this, and he enjoys a few minutes of triumph before the notorious Kite-Eating Tree eats it up (""The Kite""). After this trauma, Charlie Brown tries to find the right way to give The Little Red-Headed Girl her Valentine's Day card, but he ends up saying ""Merry Christmas"", making a fool out of himself. He goes to see Lucy, who is at her psychiatrist booth. He tells her all the things he thinks of himself. Lucy then clears it up by saying that Charlie Brown is unique the way he is, then asks for the five cent price (""The Doctor Is In""). Later, Charlie Brown sees a happy Schroeder spreading the word of Beethoven's birthday and pulling together a celebration. He and company join Schroeder in the song of jubilation (""Beethoven Day"").At noon, Linus, Lucy, Schroeder, and Charlie Brown are working on their Peter Rabbit book reports, each in his or her own way. Lucy is simply babbling to fit the 100-word requirement, Schroeder is doing a ""comparison"" between the book and Robin Hood, Linus is doing an overcomplicated psychological analysis, and Charlie Brown hasn't even started out of worry, while Sally and Snoopy chase rabbits (""The Book Report""). Act II Snoopy, in his World War I flying ace uniform climbs atop his doghouse. He goes through a scene, with him being a pilot searching for the Red Baron. In his imagination, he is defeated by the Red Baron and returns to the aerodrome in France.Sally is clearly cross about a D her teacher gave her on her homework assignment. In response, she says, ""Oh, yeah? That's what you think!"" Schroeder hears and asks why Sally is telling him that. It quickly becomes Sally's new ""philosophy"", and she bursts into song about her philosophies. Schroeder, after failing to explain to her how philosophies work, leaves in bafflement while Sally continues (""My New Philosophy"").Charlie Brown returns, and, with his friends, plays the Little League Baseball Championship. After some mishaps, the team finally manages to make some progress. Charlie Brown steps up to the plate, and despite his valiant efforts, strikes out and loses the game. We learn that this was a flashback, and Charlie Brown expresses his deep sorrow to his pen pal (""T-E-A-M (The Baseball Game)""). Lucy takes a crabbiness survey and Linus says that her crabbiness rating is ninety-five. After punching him, she realizes that she, in reality, is really very crabby.Determined not to let what happened at the championship bother him, Charlie Brown decides to join Schroeder's Glee Club and cheer up by singing ""Home on the Range"" with his friends. Unfortunately, a fight ensues between Lucy and Linus over a pencil. The fight spreads, and Charlie Brown decides to leave with his angry friends, leaving Schroeder and Snoopy the only ones singing (""Glee Club Rehearsal"").Later, Charlie Brown comes across Lucy teaching Linus about nature the way she views it, with ""facts"" such as bugs pulling the grass to make it grow or snow growing out of the ground in winter. Charlie Brown tries to correct her, but she retaliates with a false explanation, and Charlie Brown bangs his head against a tree in frustration (""Little Known Facts""). That evening, Snoopy complains that he hasn't been fed yet, and begins to overly complicate and dramatize the matter until Charlie Brown shows up with his dinner. Snoopy bursts into song about his craving for supper until Charlie Brown firmly tells him to eat his meal (""Suppertime"").That night, Charlie Brown is still sad that he has not discovered what it means to be a ""good man"", then he discovers a pencil which has been dropped by the Little Red-Haired Girl (his perennial crush). As he examines it, he discovers that ""there are teeth-marks all over it . . . she nibbles her pencil . . . she's HUMAN!"" With that realization, he concludes that today hasn't been so bad, after all, and he's done a lot of things that make him happy. As Charlie Brown expresses what makes him happy, everyone, touched by his love of life, begin to express what makes them happy as well (""Happiness""). Right then, he realizes being a ""good man"" means trying your best and making the most of the things you've been given in life. As his other friends leave the stage, Lucy turns to him and puts out her hand, making him shrink back. As he reaches out, she shakes his hand firmly, then tells him, ""You're a good man, Charlie Brown.""A medley of ""Happiness"" and ""You're A Good Man, Charlie Brown"" is performed as the cast comes out for a final curtain call.","Charlie Brown was listening how his young friends were expressing own opinions about him. Comrades admitted that he was a good person. The boy thought whether this was true. Charlie decided to find out how to become a good person. One day, the boy began to realize that he is doing badly. Suddenly he saw a little red-haired girl. Brown wanted to sit next to her, but he lacked the courage to do that. Lucy was in love with Schroeder. She asked him what he thinks of the idea of marriage. A boy knew about the feelings of a girl, but decided to stay on the sideline and continued to play the piano. Lucy knew that her aunt was right in saying that she should not discuss such things with musicians. Sally was sad because of tangled jumping-rope.  Lying in his doghouse beagle Snoopy dreamed of the jungles and wild animals. But it soon returned to reality. Appeared Linus, as usual, was wrapped-up in a blanket. Lucy and Sally began teasing him because of that. It made the boy take off his imaginary cloak. Trying to give up the habit was unsuccessful. As soon as the girl left, Linus began to dream of a place where he could quietly wear his blanket. Returned Lucy admitted that she wanted to be a queen. When the boy did not support her fantasies, she had almost hit him. Charlie was trying to fly a kite. When he was able to do it, he was pleased. But then the kite fell on the tree. Distressed, Charlie decided to switch to a more pleasant thing – he tried to give the red-haired girl valentine postcard. Dismayed, boy confused all words and wished her a Merry Christmas.  Realizing his stupid behavior, Charlie went to see a psychiatrist Lucy. The girl listened to his concerns and said – boy was good precisely because he was himself. Then Lucy demanded payment for her reception. Schroeder was happy as the day of birth composer Beethoven came. The rest of the company joined him in that celebration. Linus, Lucy, Schroeder and Charlie began to compile reports for their book. Girl was just chatting, fulfilling the plan in 100 words. Schroeder made a comparison between their magazine and Robin Hood. Linus did complicated psychological analysis. Charlie thought about what he wanted to write. Meanwhile, Sally and Snoopy were chasing rabbits. Puppy in the form of the First World War’s pilot climbed onto the doghouse and began to imagine an air fight. Defeated, beagle went back to the French base in its mind. Sally and Schroeder have started to discuss a new model of behavior of the girl that she began to apply to homework. The boy was unable to convince her that it cannot be called a philosophy.  Charlie Brown and his friends took part in a little baseball league. Their team has had some success, but the boy again had no luck in the game, and they withdrew from the struggle. When Lucy and Linus had a fight, the girl realized that she was easily irritated. Behavior of friends forced Charlie to escape from singing with Schroeder. The boy went to calm them down, and his relationship with Lucy deteriorated. Snoopy thought the owner forgot that he had to bring a dinner for his dog. When Charlie came home with food, beagle started singing. The boy had to remind the puppy of the dinner. In the evening, Brown found a pencil thrown out by his little red-haired love. Finding teeth marks on it, Charlie realized – the girl is real, and therefore, there is a chance to express his feelings to her. He soon made peace with Lucy. Now the boy understood – to be a good person, it is necessary to do the right things for other people."
Follies," In 1971, on the soon-to-be demolished stage of the Weismann Theatre, a reunion is being held to honor the Weismann's ""Follies"" shows past, and the beautiful chorus girls who performed there every year between the two World Wars. The once resplendent theatre is now little but planks and scaffolding (""Prologue""/""Overture""). As the ghosts of the young showgirls slowly drift through the theatre, a majordomo enters with his entourage of waiters and waitresses. They pass through the spectral showgirls without seeing them.Sally Durant Plummer, ""blond, petite, sweet-faced"" and at 49 ""still remarkably like the girl she was thirty years ago"", a former Weismann girl, is the first guest to arrive; her ghostly youthful counterpart moves towards her. Phyllis Rogers Stone, a stylish and elegant woman, also arrives with her husband Ben, a renowned philanthropist and politician. As their younger counterparts approach them, Phyllis comments to Ben about their past. He feigns a lack of interest; there is an underlying tension in their relationship.  As more guests arrive, Sally’s husband, Buddy, enters. He is a salesman, in his early 50s, appealing and lively, whose smiles cover inner disappointment.Finally, Weismann enters to greet his guests. Roscoe, the old master of ceremonies, introduces the former showgirls (""Beautiful Girls""). Former Weismann performers at the reunion include Max and Stella Deems, who lost their radio jobs and became store owners in Miami; Solange La Fitte, a coquette, who is vibrant and flirtatious even at 66; Hattie Walker, who has outlived five younger husbands; Vincent and Vanessa, former dancers who now own an Arthur Murray franchise; Heidi Schiller, for whom Franz Lehár once wrote a waltz (or was it Oscar Straus? Facts never interest her; what matters is the song!); and Carlotta Campion, a film star who has embraced life and benefited from every experience.As the guests reminisce, the stories of Ben, Phyllis, Buddy, and Sally unfold. Phyllis and Sally were roommates while in the Follies, and Ben and Buddy were best friends at school in New York. When Sally sees Ben, her former lover, she greets him self-consciously (""Don't Look at Me""). Buddy and Phyllis join their spouses and the foursome reminisces about the old days of their courtship and the theatre, their memories vividly coming to life in the apparitions of their young counterparts (""Waiting For The Girls Upstairs""). Each of the four is shaken at the realization of how life has changed them. Elsewhere, Willy Wheeler (portly, in his sixties) cartwheels for a photographer. Emily and Theodore Whitman, ex-vaudevillians in their seventies, perform an old routine (""The Rain on the Roof""). Solange proves she is still fashionable at what she claims is 66 (""Ah, Paris!""), and Hattie Walker performs her old showstopping number (""Broadway Baby"").Buddy warns Phyllis that Sally is still in love with Ben, and she is shaken by how the past threatens to repeat itself. Sally is awed by Ben’s apparently glamorous life, but Ben wonders if he made the right choices and considers how things might have been (""The Road You Didn't Take""). Sally tells Ben how her days have been spent with Buddy, trying to convince him (and herself) (""In Buddy’s Eyes""). But it is clear that Sally is still in love with Ben – even though their affair ended badly when Ben decided to marry Phyllis. She shakes loose from the memory and begins to dance with Ben, who is touched by the memory of the Sally he once cast aside.Phyllis interrupts this tender moment and has a biting encounter with Sally. Before she has a chance to really let loose, they are both called on to participate in another performance – Stella Deems and the ex-chorines line up to perform an old number (""Who's That Woman?""), as they are mirrored by their younger selves. Afterward, Phyllis and Ben angrily discuss their lives and relationship, which has become numb and emotionless. Sally is bitter and has never been happy with Buddy, although he has always adored her. She accuses him of having affairs while he is on the road, and he admits he has a steady girlfriend, Margie, in another town, but always returns home. Carlotta amuses a throng of admirers with a tale of how her dramatic solo was cut from the Follies because the audience found it humorous, transforming it as she sings it into a toast to her own hard-won survival (""I'm Still Here"").Ben confides to Sally that his life is empty. She yearns for him to hold her, but young Sally slips between them and the three move together (""Too Many Mornings""). Ben, caught in the passion of memories, kisses Sally as Buddy watches from the shadows. Sally thinks this is a sign that the two will finally get married, and Ben is about to protest until Sally interrupts him with a kiss and runs off to gather her things, thinking that the two will leave together. Buddy leaves the shadows furious, and fantasizes about the girl he should have married, Margie, who loves him and makes him feel like ""a somebody"", but bitterly concludes he does not love her back (""The Right Girl""). He tells Sally that he's done, but she is lost in a fantasy world, and tells him that Ben has asked her to marry him. Buddy tells her she must be either crazy or drunk, but he's already supported Sally through rehab clinics and mental hospitals and cannot take any more. Ben drunkenly propositions Carlotta, with whom he once had a fling, but she has a young lover and coolly turns him down. Heidi Schiller, joined by her younger counterpart, performs ""One More Kiss"", her aged voice a stark contrast to the sparkling coloratura of her younger self. Phyllis kisses a waiter and confesses to him that she had always wanted a son. She then tells Ben that their marriage can't continue the way it has been. Ben replies by saying that he wants a divorce, and Phyllis assumes the request is due to his love for Sally. Ben denies this, but still wants Phyllis out. Angry and hurt, Phyllis considers whether to grant his request (""Could I Leave You?"").Phyllis begins wondering at her younger self, who worked so hard to become the socialite that Ben needed. Ben yells at his younger self for not appreciating all the work that Phyllis did. Both Buddys enter to confront the Bens about how they stole Sally. Sally and her younger self enter and Ben firmly tells Sally that he never loved her. All the voices begin speaking and yelling at each other. Suddenly, at the peak of madness and confusion, the couples are engulfed by their follies, which transform the rundown theatre into a fantastical ""Loveland"", an extravaganza even more grand and opulent than the gaudiest Weismann confection: ""the place where lovers are always young and beautiful, and everyone lives only for love"". Sally, Phyllis, Ben, and Buddy show their ""real and emotional lives"" in ""a sort of group nervous breakdown.""What follows is a series of musical numbers performed by the principal characters, each exploring their biggest desires. The two younger couples sing in a counterpoint of their hopes for the future (""You're Gonna Love Tomorrow/Love Will See Us Through""). Buddy then appears, dressed in ""plaid baggy pants, garish jacket, and a shiny derby hat"", and performs a high-energy vaudeville routine depicting how he is caught between his love for Sally and Margie's love for him (""The God-Why-Don't-You-Love-Me Blues""). Sally appears next, dressed as a torch singer, singing of her passion for Ben from the past - and her obsession with him now (""Losing My Mind""). In a jazzy dance number, accompanied by a squadron of chorus boys, Phyllis reflects on the two sides of her personality, one naive and passionate and the other jaded and sophisticated and her desire to combine them (""The Story of Lucy and Jessie""). Resplendent in top hat and tails, Ben begins to offer his devil-may-care philosophy (""Live, Laugh, Love""), but stumbles and anxiously calls to the conductor for the lyrics, as he frantically tries to keep going. Ben becomes frenzied, while the dancing ensemble continues as if nothing was wrong. Amidst a deafening discord, Ben screams at all the figures from his past and collapses as he cries out for Phyllis.""Loveland"" has dissolved back into the reality of the crumbling and half-demolished theatre; dawn is approaching. Ben admits to Phyllis his admiration for her, and Phyllis shushes him and helps Ben regain his dignity before they leave. After exiting, Buddy escorts the emotionally devastated Sally back to their hotel with the promise to work things out later. Their ghostly younger selves appear, watching them go. The younger Ben and Buddy softly call to their ""girls upstairs"", and the Follies end.","In the theater, post-WWII, the action is played: there emerges the past. Previously, the theater has been successful and very lush, but now it can be compared to a human skeleton from under the skin of which bones look out – boards and drapes seen from everywhere. In the theater live the ghosts of former actresses and actors who already aged considerably – someone is about 60, another already more than 70 years old. The hall accepts guests, former actors, arriving all the evening. Some of them are successful traders; someone even in 66 years remains a coquette. For someone even an opera was dedicated in the past, but she does not remember exactly who did it – only the fact is important. Guests remember their youth, some of them are friends since childhood, someone met in college. Someone was a couple in the past (as Sally and Ben). Guests discuss how their lives have changed and whether the choices they have made were correct.  Sally is still in love with Ben. He broke her heart when he decided to marry another woman. Guests warn his wife that ex-girlfriend looking at him with a love sight. A woman wants to get rid of memories and begins to dance with a former lover. The wife interrupted the dance and a conversation with an opponent started. Later, the couple discusses their relationship and life together – they are devoid of emotions. Sally also was not happy with her husband, even though he loves her dearly. Later, however, he admits that he has a girlfriend in some city, but he always returns to his wife. Ben admits ex-girlfriend, that his life is empty. He plunges into the past and kisses a woman. She thinks that it's a sign of the fact that they will run away together from all, and goes to collect her belongings.  Ben's wife kissing waiter and he admits that he always wanted a son. She broke off relations with her husband. Looking at his young features, guests start to argue: Ben never liked Sally's for real. He loves his wife as she is. Voters begin to yell at each other, quarrel starts. That leads to a series of musical numbers where each of the characters appears in two roles: one part – a light of hope and faith in a better future, and the second – is the unfulfilled dreams and sorrows. Dawns, scattered extravaganza, the theater re-immersed in the reality. The couples assure each other in love and loyalty and past is past and run away from the world are only dreams and fantasies."
A Little Night Music,"  Act One The setting is Sweden, around the year 1900. One by one, the Quintet – five singers who comment like a Greek chorus throughout the show – enter, tuning up. Gradually, their vocalizing becomes an overture blending fragments of ""Remember"", ""Soon"" and ""The Glamorous Life"", leading into the first ""Night Waltz"". The other characters enter waltzing, each uncomfortable with her partner. After they drift back off, the aging and sardonic Madame Armfeldt and her solemn granddaughter, Fredrika, enter. Madame Armfeldt tells the child that the summer night ""smiles"" three times: first on the young, second on fools, and third on the old. Fredrika vows to watch the smiles occur. Middle-aged Fredrik Egerman is a successful lawyer. He has recently married an 18-year-old trophy wife, Anne, a naive girl who loves Fredrik but is too immature to grasp the concept of marriage. The two have been married for eleven months, but Anne still protects her virginity. Fredrik plots how he might seduce his wife (""Now""). Meanwhile, his son Henrik, a seminary student a year older than his stepmother, is frustrated and ignored (""Later""). Anne promises her husband that shortly she will consent to have sex (""Soon""), which leads into all three of them lamenting at once. Anne's maidservant Petra, an experienced and forthright girl, slightly older than the teen herself, offers her worldly but crass advice.Desiree Armfeldt is a prominent and glamorous actress who is now reduced to touring in small towns. Madam Armfeldt, Desiree's mother, has taken over the care of Desiree's daughter Fredrika. Fredrika misses her mother, but Desiree continually delays going to see her, preferring, somewhat ironically, ""The Glamorous Life"". She is performing near Fredrik's home, and Fredrik brings Anne to see the play. While there, Desiree notices Fredrik in the audience; the two had been lovers years earlier. Anne, suspicious and annoyed at Desiree's amorous glances, demands that Fredrik take her home immediately. Meanwhile, Petra tries to seduce a nervous and petulant Henrik.That night, as Fredrik remembers his past with Desiree, he sneaks out to see her; the two have a happy but strained reunion as they ""Remember"". They reflect on their new lives, and Fredrik tries to explain how much he loves Anne (""You Must Meet My Wife""). Desiree responds sarcastically and boasts of her own adultery, as she has been seeing the married dragoon, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm. Upon learning that Fredrik has gone for eleven months without sex, she agrees to accommodate him as a favor for an old friend.Madam Armfeldt offers advice to young Fredrika. The elderly woman reflects poignantly on her own checkered past, and wonders what happened to her refined ""Liaisons"". Back in Desiree's apartment, Count Carl-Magnus Malcolm proclaims his unannounced arrival in his usual booming tones. Fredrik and Desiree fob off the Count with an innocent explanation for their disheveled appearance, but he is still suspicious. He instantly dislikes Fredrik and returns to his wife, Countess Charlotte. Charlotte is quite aware of her husband's infidelity, but Carl-Magnus is too absorbed in his suspicions of Desiree to talk to her (""In Praise of Women""). When she persuades him to blurt out the whole story, a twist is revealed—Charlotte's little sister is a schoolfriend of Anne's.Charlotte visits Anne and describes Fredrik's tryst with Desiree. Anne is shocked and saddened, but Charlotte explains that such is the lot of a wife, and love brings pain (""Every Day a Little Death""). Meanwhile, Desiree asks Madame Armfeldt to host a party for Fredrik, Anne and Henrik. Though reluctant, Madam Armfeldt agrees. She sends out a personal invitation; its receipt sends Anne into a frenzy, imagining ""A Weekend in the Country"" with the Armfeldts. Anne does not want to accept the invitation, but Charlotte convinces her to do so to heighten the contrast between the older woman and the young and beautiful teenager. Charlotte relates this to the Count, who (much to her chagrin) decides to visit the Armfeldts uninvited. Carl-Magnus plans to challenge Fredrik to a duel, while Charlotte hopes to seduce the lawyer to make her husband jealous and end his philandering. The act ends as all characters set off to Madam Armfeldt's estate. Act Two Madam Armfeldt's country estate is bathed in the golden glow of perpetual summer sunset at this high latitude (""Night Waltz One and Two""). Everyone arrives, each with their own amorous purposes and desires—even Petra, who catches the eye of Armfeldt's fetching manservant, Frid. The women begin to quarrel with one another. Fredrik is astonished to learn the name of Desiree's daughter. Henrik meets Fredrika, and confesses his deep love for Anne to her. Meanwhile, in the garden, Fredrik and Carl-Magnus reflect on how difficult it is to be annoyed with Desiree, agreeing ""It Would Have Been Wonderful"" had she not been quite so wonderful. Dinner is served, and the characters' ""Perpetual Anticipation"" enlivens the meal.At dinner, Charlotte attempts to flirt with Fredrik, and trades insults with Desiree. Soon, everyone is shouting and scolding everyone else, except for Henrik, who finally speaks up. He accuses the whole company of being amoral, and flees the scene. Stunned, everyone reflects on the situation and wanders away. Fredrika tells Anne of Henrik's secret love, and the two dash off searching for him. Meanwhile, Desiree meets Fredrik and asks if he still wants to be ""rescued"" from his life. Fredrik answers honestly that he loves Desiree, but cannot bring himself to part with Anne. Hurt and bitter, Desiree can only reflect on the nature of her life and relationship to Fredrik (""Send In the Clowns""). Anne finds Henrik, who is attempting to commit suicide. The clumsy boy cannot complete the task, and Anne tells him that she loves him, too. The pair begins to kiss, which leads to Anne's first sexual encounter. Meanwhile, not far away, Frid sleeps in Petra's lap. The maid imagines advantageous marriages, but concludes that in the meantime, ""a girl ought to celebrate what passes by"" (""The Miller's Son""). Charlotte confesses her plan to Fredrik, and both watch as Henrik and Anne, happy together, run away to start their new life. The two commiserate on a bench. Carl-Magnus, preparing to romance Desiree, sees this and challenges Fredrik to Russian Roulette, at which a nervous Fredrik misfires and simply grazes his own ear. Victorious, Carl-Magnus begins to romance Charlotte, granting her wish at last.After the Count and Countess leave, Fredrika and Madam Armfeldt discuss the chaos of the recent turns-of-events. The elderly woman then asks Fredrika a surprising question: ""What is it all for?"" Fredrika thinks about this, and decides that love, for all of its frustrations, ""must be worth it"". Madam Armfeldt is surprised, ruefully noting that she rejected love for material wealth at Fredrika's age. She praises her granddaughter and remembers true love's fleeting nature.Fredrik finally confesses his love for Desiree, acknowledging that Fredrika is his daughter, and the two promise to start a new life together (""Send in the Clowns"" (Reprise)). Madam Armfeldt sits alone with Fredrika. Fredrika tells her grandmother that she has watched carefully, but still has not seen the night smile. Madam Armfeldt laughs and points out that the night has indeed smiled twice: first on Henrik and Anne, the young, and second on Desiree and Fredrik, the fools. As the two wait for the ""third smile... on the old"", it occurs: Madam Armfeldt closes her eyes, and dies peacefully with Fredrika beside her.","Sweden. 1900. Couples are waltzing. Madame Armfeldt told her granddaughter that summer night smiles thrice: in youth, to stupidity & in old age. Fredrik is a prosperous advocate. 11 months ago, mature man espoused a girl named Anne of 18 y.o., but she still did not give herself to her husband. Fredrik have a son, who is a year older than her stepmother. Henrik is seminarian & isn’t taken seriously by surrounding people, because of which he was severely depressed. Anne was interested in boy, but could not take him as her stepson. Soon, the young wife pledged to her consort that she will spend the soiree with him.  While the canary Desiree toured small towns, her mother took over the care of her granddaughter. Fredrik visited the show of Desiree, together with his spouse Anne. The youthful wife did not like the gazes that the canary casted on her partner & wanted to go home. Anne didn’t know about Fredrik’s & Desiree’s former on-love. Soon, a man visited the actress & they talked about personal life. When she learned that a lawyer for a long time is missing for intercourse relations, Desiree decided to help in this.  Suddenly a woman's lover arrived – Count Carl-Magnus. Lawyer & actress pretended like nothing had happened between them. When the count has returned to his home, he was full of suspicions. Charlotte knew about her husband's infidelity. Soon she found out what had happened in his mistress's apartment. Suddenly, the woman realized that she knows Fredrik – his wife was a friend of her younger sister. Charlotte went to Anne & told her about her husband-traitor. Young woman could hardly believe it. Soon Desiree asked her mother to make a party for Fredrik, Anne & Henrik. The woman barely managed to persuade Madame Armfeldt to arrange it. After receiving the invitation, Anne wanted to give it up, but Charlotte has advised her to give a positive answer. The wife could beat rival with her youth, just being nearby. Carl-Magnus decided to visit the holiday without an invitation – Earl wanted to make a gift to Charlotte for her birthday. He also planned to call Fredrik on a duel. His wife decided to flirt at a party with a lawyer, hoping to attract the attention of her husband once again.  Arriving at the Armfeldt mansion, Fredrik was surprised to learn that the 13-year-old daughter of Desiree named Fredrika. Henrik told the girl about his secret love to Anne. Soon count & lawyer began to discuss Desiree, regretting the fact that this woman is so beautiful. In the meantime, at dinner, Charlotte flirted with Fredrik; Anne began to quarrel with Desiree. Henrik could not bear it. The young man accused present ones in immorality & left them. After dinner, Fredrika told Anne about the feelings of Henrik & they went in searches for him. Lawyer admitted to Desiree that he still loves her, despite her selfishness. Anne found Henrik in the moment when he unsuccessfully tried to commit suicide. She admitted that she loves the boy. Soon, they were already at each other's hugs. Lovers have decided to escape & begin to build their lives on their own. They tried to shoot Carl-Magnus, infuriated by such behavior, but were stopped by Charlotte & Desiree & left the scene.  Countess decided to tell Fredrik about her plan for the return to her husband. Their appointment was eavesdropped by Carl-Magnus. He forced the lawyer to play with him in Russian roulette & was satisfied that the bullet grazed the ear of his opponent. Count again began to pay attention to Charlotte. Fredrik realized that Fredrika is his daughter. Revealing each other in love, a lawyer & actress decided to unite their destinies. Soon Madame Armfeldt died. Thus, summer night showed its smile for the 3rd time."
La Cage aux Folles,"  Act I Georges, the master of ceremonies, welcomes the audience to his St. Tropez drag nightclub, ""La Cage aux Folles"". The chorus line known as Les Cagelles appear and introduce themselves to the audience (""We Are What We Are""). Georges and his ""wife"", Albin, have lived happily together for many years in an apartment above La Cage with their ""maid"" Jacob. Albin is a drag queen and the star performer of La Cage aux Folles under the alias of ""Zaza"".As Albin prepares to perform (""[A Little More] Mascara""), Georges's 24-year-old son Jean-Michel (the offspring of a confused, youthful liaison with a woman named Sybil) arrives home with the news that he is engaged to Anne Dindon. Georges is reluctant to approve of Jean-Michel's engagement, but Jean-Michel assures his father that he is in love with Anne (""With Anne on My Arm""). Unfortunately, her father is head of the ""Tradition, Family and Morality Party"", whose stated goal is to close the local drag clubs. Anne's parents want to meet their daughter's future in-laws. Jean-Michel has lied to his fiancée, describing Georges as a retired diplomat. Jean-Michel pleads with Georges to tell Albin to absent himself (and his flamboyant behaviors) for the visit - and for Georges to redecorate the apartment in a more subdued fashion. Jean-Michel also asks Georges to invite Sybil, who has barely seen him since his birth, to dinner in Albin's stead. Albin returns from the show to greet his son when Georges suggests that they take a walk (""With You on My Arm"").Georges takes Albin to the Promenade Café, owned by Monsieur and Madame Renaud, where he attempts to soften Albin's emotions before telling him of Jean-Michel's request (""Song on the Sand""). Before Georges can break the news to him, Albin suggests that they hurry back to La Cage to make it in time for the next show. They arrive in time and Albin takes the stage once more as Zaza (""La Cage aux Folles""). While Albin is performing, Georges and Jean-Michel quickly redecorate the house. While Albin is changing for his next number, he notices the two carrying his gowns and demands to know what is going on. Georges finally tells Albin of Jean-Michel's plan and expects Albin to explode with fury, but he remains silent. Albin then re-joins Les Cagelles onstage, tells them to leave, and begins to sing alone in defiance of Jean-Michel, stating that he is proud of who he is and refuses to change for anyone (""I Am What I Am""). He throws his wig at Georges and departs in a huff. Act II The next morning, Georges finds Albin at the Promenade Café after his abrupt departure and apologizes (""Song on the Sand [Reprise]""). He then suggests to Albin that he dress up for dinner as macho ""Uncle Al"". Albin is still upset, but reluctantly agrees to act like a heterosexual for Jean-Michel. With the help of Monsieur and Madame Renaud, Georges successfully teaches Albin to abandon his flamboyancy (""Masculinity""). Back at the chastely redesigned apartment, Georges shows ""Uncle Al"" to Jean-Michel. Jean-Michel doesn't like the idea and expresses his dislike for Albin's lifestyle. Georges angrily reminds Jean-Michel of how good of a ""mother"" Albin has been to him (""Look Over There""). They then receive a telegram that Jean-Michel's mother Sybil is not coming and Anne's parents arrive (""Dishes [Cocktail Counterpoint]""). Hoping to save the day, Albin appears as Jean-Michel's buxom, forty-year-old mother, in pearls and sensible shoes. The nervous Jacob burns the dinner, so a trip to a local restaurant, ""Chez Jacqueline"", belonging to an old friend of Albin and Georges, is quickly arranged. No one has told Jacqueline of the situation, and she asks Albin (as Zaza) for a song, to which he hesitantly agrees (""The Best of Times""). Everyone in the restaurant begins to take part in the song, causing Albin to yield to the frenzy of performance and tear off his wig at the song's climax, revealing his true identity.Back at the apartment, the Dindons plead with their daughter to abandon her fiancé, for they are appalled by his homosexual parents, but she is in love with Jean-Michel and refuses to leave him. Jean-Michel, deeply ashamed of the way he has treated Albin, asks his forgiveness (""Look Over There [Reprise]""), which is lovingly granted. The Dindons prepare to depart, but their way is blocked by Jacqueline, who has arrived with the press, ready to photograph the notorious anti-homosexual activists with Zaza. Georges and Albin have a proposal: If Anne and Jean-Michel may marry, Georges will help the Dindons escape through La Cage downstairs. Georges bids the audience farewell while Les Cagelles prepare the Dindons for the grand finale (""La Cage aux Folles [Reprise]""). Georges then introduces the Dindons, dressed in drag as members of the nightclub's revue, and they escape the paparazzi with Jean-Michel and Anne behind them. With everyone gone, Albin enters and he and Georges briefly sing of their love for each other before sharing a kiss (""Finale [With You On My Arm/La Cage aux Folles/Song on the Sand/The Best Of Times]"").","A couple of elderly gay men enjoying life in the city on the shore of the warm sea and each other's company. This is not just a pair of men living together. They are the weird owners of the nightclub named La Cage Aux Folles (“The Cage of The Crazy Ones”). The place is quite questionable, as can be judged on the appearance of people acting in this club. Outwardly respectable George manages the affairs of the place, trying not to give out in his behavior somewhat unconventional inclinations. His friend Albin is a transvestite cabaret singer (he performs under the name of Zaza). This is a typical, stereotypical and somewhat grotesque image of the homosexuality: Zaza is too feminine, campy, whimsical, and with all his theater-like manners, trying to be like a woman.  But one day the life of two elderly birdies literally turned upside down. Georges is visited by his son Jean-Michel (the result of a light affair in his youth), and says that he intends to marry Anne Dindon. It would seem nothing wrong with that. But it turns out that the girl's father is a leader of a party of fighters for moral purity. This prim gentleman is an ardent struggler for morality, a notorious homophobe and bigot. If he finds out what the groom's father do and about his sexual inclinations – the wedding is off. Now the head of the family and his loyal friend must at all costs try to hide the truth, not to let down a couple in love.  It was decided to do so that before the coming of the bride's parents their house looked not like a homosexual’s couple one, but was as much as possible respectable. An attempt was made to remove for a certain time Albin, but capricious ""diva"" was terribly offended. Nothing can be done: George had to present him as his wife. The head of an unusual family is presented himself as an art person. Accidentally, mutual friend, who does not know what was happening, exposes Albin.  Scandal is upcoming: the parents are trying to persuade Anne to give up the groom, but she loves Jean-Michel very much and is not going to break with him. The situation is saved by Jacqueline, who brings a representative of the press. Paparazzi are happy to shoot the controversial report about the head of the party of moralists, who is in close relations to the canary-transvestite. Georges and Albin offer the bride's parents to hide from papz, but under one condition: the younglings should be together. Chairman of the party of moral purity and his wife, dressed-up as actors in costumes of the nightclub, are hiding from the press. In the final scene, Georges and Albin sing about love for each other. The play ends with a strong kiss of men in love."
Urinetown,"  Act I The show opens with a grim welcome from Officer Lockstock, a policeman, assisted by the street urchin Little Sally. According to Lockstock and Little Sally, a twenty-year drought has caused a terrible water shortage, making private toilets unthinkable. All restroom activities are done in public toilets controlled by a megacorporation called ""Urine Good Company"" (or UGC). To control water consumption, people have to pay to use the amenities (""Too Much Exposition""). There are harsh laws ensuring that people pay to urinate, and if the laws are broken, the offender is sent to a penal colony called ""Urinetown"", never to return.The oppressed masses huddle in line at the poorest, filthiest urinal in town, Public Amenity #9, which is run by the rigid, harshly authoritarian Penelope Pennywise and her assistant, dashing young everyman Bobby Strong. Trouble ensues when Bobby's father, Old Man Strong, cannot afford his urinal admission for the day and asks Pennywise to let him go free ""just this once"". After Old Man Strong's plea is dismissed (""It's a Privilege to Pee""), he urinates on the street and is soon arrested by Officers Lockstock and Barrel and escorted off to Urinetown. (""It's a Privilege to Pee - Reprise"").Later that day, in the corporate offices of Urine Good Company, the CEO, Caldwell B. Cladwell, is discussing the new fee hikes with Senator Fipp, a politician firmly in Cladwell's pocket, when Cladwell's beautiful daughter, Hope Cladwell, arrives on the scene as the UGC's new fax/copy girl. By way of introduction, the UGC staff sing a song in praise of their chief (""Mr. Cladwell"").Officers Lockstock and Barrel discuss the journey to Urinetown and how it reduces everyone, even the toughest, to screams (""The Cop Song""). Hope enters and encounters Bobby Strong. Bobby, distraught over his father's arrest and wondering if he could have done something, tells Hope that his heart feels either cold or empty. Hope tells Bobby that the only answer is to follow his heart. The two realize that they both want a new world where the people can be happy and pee for free, and united by their belief, fall in love (""Follow Your Heart""). Little Sally asks Officer Lockstock what Urinetown is like, but Lockstock replies that its power lies in its mystery and he cannot flippantly reveal that ""there is no Urinetown, we just kill people"", and that the reveal will not come until Act II, ""with everybody singing and things like that.""The next day, Cladwell's assistant, Mr. McQueen, announces the new fee hikes set upon the urinals. Bobby concludes that the laws are wrong. Opening the doors of the urinal, despite Ms. Pennywise's protests, he begins a pee-for-free rebellion (""Look at the Sky"").Pennywise rushes to the offices of UGC, where she informs Cladwell of the revolution. The two give each other long, meaningful looks, but they are interrupted by the situation at hand. Cladwell vows to crush the rebellion, frightening Hope. Cladwell, by way of a series of increasingly convoluted metaphors involving a bunny, tells Hope that it is their privilege and responsibility to stomp on the poor (""Don't Be the Bunny"").Cladwell, McQueen, Fipp, Pennywise, Lockstock and Barrel arrive at Amenity #9 to snuff out the uprising. Bobby learns that Hope is Cladwell's daughter. Bobby realizes that the only way out of the trap is to kidnap Hope to use as leverage against Cladwell. The rebel poor escape with Hope as their hostage. The police give chase, but the slow-motion choreography makes it impossible for the police to catch them. Lockstock vows to catch the poor as he tells the audience to enjoy intermission (""Act I Finale""). Act II Lockstock welcomes everyone back. He catches the audience up on the situation, and tells them that the rebel poor are holed up in a secret hideout somewhere, gesturing to a large sign that reads ""Secret Hideout."" The sign leads to the sewers, where the rebels are holding Hope hostage. The rebels wonder what Urinetown is, and two of them, Little Becky Two-Shoes and Hot Blades Harry, explain their theories. Cladwell orders Lockstock to search harder for the rebels, threatening that he will send everyone to Urinetown if Hope is not found. Bobby and his mother Josephine hand out memos to the other Assistant Custodians in hope that they will join them. Bobby is sure that Urinetown is nothing but a lie designed to keep the poor people in fear. Lockstock catches Little Sally, but she is unfazed by his threat of Urinetown, because as she sees it, they are already in Urinetown; it ""isn't so much a place as it is a metaphysical place"" that they are all in, including Lockstock. She escapes before Lockstock can ask her what ""metaphysical"" means. (""What is Urinetown?"").Convinced that Bobby, Josephine, and Little Sally have been captured, the rebels, particularly Hot Blades Harry and Little Becky Two-Shoes, decide that the best way to get revenge on Cladwell is to kill Hope (""Snuff That Girl""). They are about to kill her when Bobby bursts in and reminds the rebels that their purpose is more than just revenge. He explains that he made a promise that all the people of the land would be free. One of the rebels reminds Bobby that the only words he said were ""Run, everybody, run for your lives, run."" Bobby explains that in the heat of battle the cry of freedom sounds something like (""Run, Freedom, Run!""). Invigorated, the poor rally around Bobby, but balk at his statement that the violent fight could take decades. Just then, Pennywise bursts into the secret hideout telling Bobby that Cladwell wants him to come to the UGC headquarters. Bobby goes, but only after being reminded by the impatient rebels that if anything happens to him, Hope will be killed. Pennywise fiercely swears that if any of the rebels harm Hope, she will have Bobby sent off to Urinetown. Bobby says goodbye to Hope, apologizes, and tells her to think of what they have (""Follow Your Heart - Reprise"").At the UGC headquarters, Bobby is offered a suitcase full of cash and full amnesty to the rebels as long as Hope is returned and the people agree to the new fee hikes. Bobby refuses, and demands free access for the people. Cladwell orders the cops to escort Bobby to Urinetown—even if it means that the rebel poor will kill Hope. Horrified, Pennywise marvels at the depth of Cladwell's evil. Cladwell has her arrested as well. She, Hope, and Fipp sing of their regrets of falling for Cladwell's schemes. Meanwhile, Bobby is led to the top of the UGC building, and learns the truth: Urinetown is death. Bobby regrets having ever listened to his heart. Lockstock and Barrel throw him off the building (""Why Did I Listen To That Man?""), killing him.Little Sally returns to the hideout in a shocked daze, having just heard Bobby's last words. The ghost of Bobby sings, along with Little Sally, his last words, which are directed to Hope (""Tell Her I Love Her""). His last words encourage the rebels ""to fight for what they know is right,"" and that ""the time is always now.""  Just as the rebels are about to murder Hope in revenge, Pennywise enters and offers herself instead, proclaiming herself to be Hope's mother. The poor reel back, shocked by this unexpected twist. Hope convinces the rebels to let her lead them, and she, Penny, and the poor march to the offices of UGC. On the way, they kill Officer Barrel, who had just confessed his love to Officer Lockstock, Senator Fipp, and Mrs. Millennium (“We're Not Sorry"").Hope reveals to her father that she is still alive. Cladwell is overjoyed, until the rest of the poor reveal themselves. Hope tells him that his reign of terror is over, and that he will ""be sent to the same place he sent Bobby and all those who wouldn't—or couldn't—meet his criminal fee hikes"". Cladwell pleads to the people that he is their only chance at seeing tomorrow, but it is no use. Pennywise and Cladwell reminisce about their past romance (""We're Not Sorry (Reprise)""). Cladwell is led to the roof, shouting that he regrets nothing, and however cruel he might have been, he ""kept the pee off the street and the water in the ground."" He is thrown off.With the town at peace at last, the age of fear is over and the people look forward to a bright new day. The Urine Good Company is renamed ""The Bobby Strong Memorial Toilet Authority"" and the people are henceforth allowed ""to pee whenever they like, as much as they like, for as long as they like, and with whomever they like"" (""I See A River"").However, the town's newfound urinary bliss is short-lived, as its limited water supply quickly disappears. Lockstock tells the audience that, as draconian as the UGC's rules were, they kept the people from squandering the limited water supply; now, much of the population dies of thirst. It is insinuated that Hope suffers a terrible death at the hand of the people for her actions in depleting the water supply, but the remaining townsfolk will wage on, their town now quite like the imaginary ""Urinetown"" with which they had been threatened for years.","The near future. The human activity has led to water shortages. People live in cities and are forced to visit only the public toilets to relieve themselves. Mega-concern ‘Urine Good Company’ holds control over such institutions. The life of the population depends on the decisions of the toilet authorities. Everyone has to pay for the natural needs; if he is unable to do this – he forcibly send to Urinetown. What is happening there – is not known. No one returned from there, everyone is afraid to get there.  In a poor district of the city, there is a big queue to the toilet. Bobby works as an assistant of hostess of the place – greedy Mrs. Pennywise, who is stingy and never let anyone in for free. Comes Bobby's father and asks to let him in the toilet just once without charge. The hostess refuses, so he is forced to relieve himself directly nearby. Police takes him for this, sending in Urinetown.  In ‘Urine Good Company’ the head of the entire corporation Cladwell discusses raising the payment for toilet usage. Daughter of the manager, Hope, works there as a secretary, faces Bobby one day and a feeling erupts between younglings.  The increase of payment is announced. Bobby is against such decision of the authorities, and opens the doors to everyone who wants to get to the toilet for free. Riot is maturing, police arrive, Mr. Cladwell is preparing to destroy Bobby despite the fact that he is liked by his daughter. Due to the numerical superiority, ordinary residents temporarily win the fight. They manage to steal Miss Hope and hide her. Only now, Bobby finds out who his beloved is.  People temporarily get underground and hide in the sewer systems. They understand that the opposition cannot last forever. The rebels are trying to blackmail the authorities that they have Hope are ask to set free use of toilets.  Mr. Cladwell lures Bobby, offering him a suitcase full of money, the forgiveness of all those who participated in the riot, if people return him his daughter and agree with the new fee rates for the toilet’s use. He refuses, believing that people have the right to relieve their natural needs without charge. The police take Bobby in Urinetown. In fact, they throw him off the roof, as they do with everyone who violates public order. Urinetown turns out a fictional place.  Poor people, learning about the essence of Urinetown and death of Bobby, are ready to kill Hope. Then it turns out that Miss Pennywise is the mother of a hostage. People do not touch the girl, shocked by the news. Hope takes the leadership of the revolution into own hands. People break into corporation, grab Cladwell and throw him off the roof. There comes a universal prosperity – now anyone can go to the toilet as much as he wants. But general happiness does not last long – the water reserves are being depleted, people are doomed. After all, ‘Urine Good Company’ was able to maintain a reasonable consumption of water and somehow delayed the inevitable retribution."
Sunset Boulevard,"  Act I In 1949 Hollywood, down-on-his-luck screenwriter Joe Gillis tries to hustle up some work at Paramount Studios (""Let's Have Lunch""). His appointment with a producer goes poorly when the executive rejects both Joe's proposed script and a loan to bring his car payments up to date. Joe does, however, meet Betty Schaefer, a pretty, young script editor who suggests they collaborate to rework one of his earlier screenplays. As they chat, Joe is spotted by car repossession agents and makes a quick escape.During the chase that ensues, Joe evades his pursuers by pulling in to the garage of a palatial but dilapidated mansion on Sunset Boulevard. Beckoned inside the house, Joe encounters Norma Desmond, the ""greatest star of all"" who ruled the silent film era but didn't make the transition to sound movies. Taken aback, Joe comments, ""You used to be in pictures; you used to be big,"" to which Norma retorts, ""I am big — it's the pictures that got small!""The gloomy estate is inhabited only by Norma and Max, her loyal butler and chauffeur. Although decades past her prime and mostly forgotten by the public, Norma is convinced she is as beautiful and in demand as ever. Max perpetuates this illusion by shielding her from the realities of life out of the limelight and by writing her letters purportedly from still-devoted fans. Norma informs Joe of her plan to return to the screen with Salome, a script she has written for Cecil B. DeMille to direct with her in the starring role as the teenage biblical temptress. Dubious but sensing opportunity, Joe accepts her offer of work as editor on the script. Norma insists that Joe stay in her home while they collaborate on Salome.Joe immediately realizes the script is incoherent, but Norma won't allow a major rewrite and the revision drags on for months. During this time Joe is a virtual prisoner at the house, but he does break away to fulfill his commitment to Betty. Their working relationship blossoms into a romance that has her reconsidering her engagement to Joe's best friend, Artie (""Girl Meets Boy"").Blind to Joe's opportunism, Norma lavishes him with gifts that include a wardrobe makeover and he becomes her kept man (""The Lady's Paying""). She declares her love for him and turns quite possessive (""The Perfect Year""); when he leaves her to attend Artie's New Year's Eve party (""This Time Next Year""), she is distraught and attempts suicide. As a conciliatory gesture, Joe reluctantly returns to work on Salome. Act II A cryptic message from Paramount has Norma certain that DeMille is eager to discuss her script. She drops in on the set of his current film and is greeted warmly by former colleagues and the famed director himself, but DeMille is noncommittal about Salome. Meanwhile, Max discovers the studio had called to ask about Norma's exotic car, not her screenplay. However, a delusional Norma leaves the lot convinced she'll soon be back in front of the cameras and begins to prepare for the role (""As If We Never Said Goodbye"").Increasingly paranoid, Norma deduces that Joe and Betty are more than just friends (""Too Much in Love to Care""). She calls the younger woman to reveal Joe's secret life at the mansion, but he overhears and grabs the phone to tell Betty to come see for herself. Realizing their affair is doomed, Joe brusquely tells her he enjoys being Norma's pet and that she should go back to Artie. Betty departs, confused and brokenhearted, and Joe tells Norma he is leaving her and returning to his hometown in Ohio. He also bluntly informs her that Salome is an unfilmable script and her fans have long abandoned her. Furious and grief-stricken, Norma fatally shoots Joe three times as he storms out of the house.Now completely insane, Norma mistakes the swarms of police and reporters who arrive for studio personnel. Believing she is on the set of Salome, she slowly descends her grand staircase and utters ""And now, Mr. DeMille, I am ready for my close-up.""","The action takes place in 1949 in Hollywood. A young screenwriter Joe is experiencing a creative decline. All his works are rejected by the management of the studios, and the situation is compounded by the fact that all his property is mortgaged, and bank officers from collection department are hunting him down.

To do this, she wrote a scenario where the main female role of 16-year-old biblical temptress was assigned to her. As screenwriter needed help in his difficult life situation, so for food and shelter he took the job to finish the script.  Almost immediately, the young man noticed that the script was complete failure.

One morning, in the house of the actress rang the telephone. Paramount film studio invited a woman to discuss the production of the new film. Despite the fact that the meeting was quite warm, no one mentioned the script, written by the actress. Butler suggested that the purpose of the meeting was not the film itself, and the studio management was not interested in the actress indeed. Their sole purpose was to get permission to shoot in the film an antique car, which she owned. These arguments did not make any impression on the actress, because she still believed that she was at the peak of glory.  Norma discovers that her lover and representative of studio Betty are more than just friends. She calls her rival, to tell the truth about her beloved, but writer, overhearing a conversation, grabs the phone from her hands.

Aladdin initially shrugs this off in disbelief, prompting the Genie to display his powers with an impressive musical number (""Friend Like Me""). The Genie then reveals that he has limitations to his powers. He can't grant wishes that include murder, romance, revival of the dead, or wishing for additional wishes. Amused and overjoyed at his good fortune, Aladdin tricks Genie into magically freeing them from the cave without actually using a wish; thereafter, Genie states that Aladdin will not receive any more magic help unless he explicitly states ""I wish"". Genie confides that he would wish for freedom, since he is a prisoner of his lamp, so Aladdin promises to use his last wish to free the Genie. Aladdin decides to use his first wish to become a prince in order to be legally able to court Jasmine (Act One Finale: ""Friend Like Me""/""Proud of Your Boy"" (Reprises)). Act II A great parade storms through the streets of Agrabah, led by Genie, Babkak, Omar and Kassim. They announce the arrival of ""Prince Ali of Ababwa"" (""Prince Ali""). Once at the palace, Aladdin, disguised as Prince Ali, expresses to the Sultan his desire to marry Jasmine. Jasmine overhears the conversation and perceives Ali to be just another shallow prince. Jafar, who is suspicious of Ali, tells him the location of Jasmine's bedroom, not mentioning that it is against Agrabah law for the Princess to have a suitor in her quarters unsupervised. Aladdin courts Jasmine with a ride on his magic carpet provided to him by Genie (""A Whole New World""). Once they return, Jasmine recognizes Aladdin as the young man whom she met in the marketplace. Aladdin lies and says that he really is a prince, he just sometimes likes to dress as a commoner to escape the pressures of palace living, much like Jasmine did that day. Seeing he isn't shallow and self-absorbed like the others, Jasmine kisses Aladdin good night. After she leaves, Jafar has Aladdin arrested for entering the Princess' room unsupervised. Upon hearing the news, Babkak, Omar and Kassim storm the palace to rescue their friend (""High Adventure""). They are captured and thrown into the dungeon as well, but with a little help from Genie, Aladdin uses his second wish to free them (""Somebody's Got Your Back"").The Sultan greets Aladdin in the hall and gives him his blessing to marry Jasmine, meaning that Aladdin himself will inherit the throne as the new Sultan one day. Fearful of this great responsibility, he tells Genie he's going to save his third wish for a day he may need it rather than use it to free Genie like he promised. Distraught, Genie returns to his lamp and refuses to speak to Aladdin. Aladdin laments (""Proud of Your Boy"" (Reprise II)). Meanwhile, Jafar and Iago manage to steal the lamp that Aladdin carelessly discarded.As the Sultan announces to the public that Jasmine is to wed Prince Ali (""Prince Ali"" (Sultan Reprise)), Jafar appears and reveals Ali to be merely a common street rat named Aladdin whom the former then threatens to send to ""the end of the road"" if no one changes the latter's personality to meet his standards (""Prince Ali"" (Jafar Reprise)). Genie then enters with Jasmine in chains, saying that Jafar is now his master and that his first wish was to make Jasmine his prisoner. Jafar uses his second wish to crown himself Sultan, which Genie reluctantly grants. Remembering what Genie told him earlier about the limitations to his powers, Aladdin tricks Jafar into wishing for himself to become a genie so that his power will be unmatched. Genie grants Jafar's wish, and Jafar is sucked into a lamp of his own, bound to it for eternity.Aladdin uses his third and final wish to set Genie free. He then admits to Jasmine that he loves her, but he cannot pretend to be someone he's not. Seeing the nobility in Aladdin, the Sultan decrees that henceforth the Princess can marry whomever she pleases. Babkak, Omar and Kassim are made royal advisors, while Iago is arrested. Aladdin and Jasmine are married, and Genie prepares for a long-awaited vacation. All ends well as Aladdin and Jasmine board the magic carpet and take flight (Finale Ultimo: ""Arabian Nights""/""A Whole New World"" (Reprises)).","The action takes place in a conventional middle-eastern city named Agrabah. Aladdin is one of the misfits on the streets of this city, stealing food trying to survive. When his mother dies, he decides to put an end to worthless vagrant living and gives himself a covenant never to steal, and generally prove to the world that he worth something. As it turned out, soon it becomes possible, because Jafar, Grand Vizier of the city, in an attempt to fight for the throne, wants to get into some kind of mysterious cave, in which he will find a lot of knowledge, but to get there he must be able to find out Aladdin and use his help, because grottos cave opens only to him, because he is like a rough diamond (Diamond In The Rough). Then he and Jasmine – the princess and very naughty girl – face in the city, when Aladdin fun in idleness with his friends. They are imbued with sympathy for each other and they are hiding in the time a secluded place, where telling each other about their heavy fates and how uncomfortable they feel in current positions. Then Jasmine detected by custody and Aladdin is going to be executed, but rescued by fate with face of Jafar, who takes him to the cave, so he would opened it.  During the opening of the grottos, we find that Aladdin should pass magic lamp to Jafar and strictly touch nothing. But since he had broken this vault, trying to rake at least a few gold coins of those who were in the cave among the countless treasures, the cave shut, leaving him alone in the dark. He accidentally rubs the lamp and it turns out that it is a genie sitting there, which comes out and is ready to fulfill three wishes of Aladdin. Deceiving him, Aladdin is secured himself from the cave using no wishes, but then takes the first – to become a prince.  Aladdin unreasonably treats to the opportunities that a genie gave him – he uses the second wish on to get out of prison, and the third wish reserves for himself, rather than to free a genie. He resents on Aladdin and returns to the lamp, which was then stolen by one of his friends (who was rescued the previous day from the prison, ungrateful!). Aladdin will soon become the new ruler and very scared of this.  Jafar becomes the owner of the lamp and becomes the first sultan, and then wants to become a genie and got sucked into the lamp for an endless imprisonment. Aladdin sets genie free and sultan allows Jasmine marry Aladdin. They all continue living happily ever after."
Anastasia,"  Prologue In 1906, in  St. Petersburg, Russia, the Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna comforts her youngest granddaughter, 7 year-old Princess Anastasia who is saddened by the fact that her grandmother is moving to Paris, France. Before leaving, the Dowager Empress gives Anastasia a music box as a parting gift (""Prologue: Once Upon a December""). Eleven years later, 17 year-old Anastasia is attending a ball with her family when the Bolsheviks invade the palace. As the Romanovs attempt to escape, Anastasia tries to retrieve her music box only to be shot and presumed dead along with the rest of her family (""The Last Dance of the Romanovs""). Act I In 1927, Gleb Vaganov, a general for the Bolsheviks who now controls Russia, announces to the gloomy Russians that the now-poor Saint Petersburg has been renamed Leningrad, and he promises a bright and peaceful future. The Russians protest this change, but are uplifted by a rumor that Anastasia may have survived the Bolshevik attacks. Two wanted con men, the handsome young Dmitry and an ex-member of the Imperial Court named Vlad Popov hear the rumors and brainstorm “the biggest con in history”: they will groom a naive girl to become Anastasia in order to extract money from the Dowager Empress (“A Rumor in St. Petersburg"").Dmitry and Vlad hold unsuccessful auditions for the scheme at the theater in the abandoned Yusupov Palace. Just as they are about to give up hope of finding a suitable impostor, a street sweeper named Anya walks in to ask Dmitry about paperwork to get tickets for Paris. Dmitry and Vlad become fascinated as Anya explains that she doesn't remember who she is due to her amnesia and has very few memories of her past (“In My Dreams”). Amazed by her memory loss and resemblance to Anastasia, they select Anya as their impostor.At the capital, government workers sort through rumors and reports for any that require further action. Three bitter actresses report Anya, Dmitry, and Vlad's plot to Gleb, but he dismisses them and files a case for Anya (“The Rumors Never End”). Back at the palace, Vlad and Dmitry groom a feisty Anya to become Anastasia through history, dining, and dancing lessons (“Learn to Do It”).Gleb orders Anya's arrest, and she is brought to his office in the Nevsky Prospect. The general interrogates the girl and warns her about the consequences of pretending to be Anastasia. He tries to convince her that Anastasia is really dead. He reveals that his father was the one who shot the Romanovs and, as a boy, he heard the gunshots and their screams. However, Gleb notices that Anya has the ""Romanov eyes"" and realizes that Anya could indeed be Anastasia. As he harbors feelings for her, he lets her off with a warning (""The Neva Flows"").Anya reunites with Dmitry, and they are teased and attacked by his old con partners whom they must fight off (“The Neva Flows Reprise”). Impressed by Anya's fighting skills, Dmitry opens up to her for the first time and tells her about his childhood in the streets of St. Petersburg and how he had to take care of himself as an orphan (“My Petersburg”). Dmitry begins to trust her enough to show her a music box that he's failed to open, unaware it is the memento that was given to Anastasia by the Dowager Empress. Anya easily winds and opens the box and begins to vaguely remember her past including an imperial ball many years earlier (“Once Upon a December”). After this episode, Anya is more resolute than ever in her desire to get to Paris, but Dmitry tells her that they don't have enough money to buy the train tickets. Then, she gives him her most prized possession, a diamond that was found sewn to her dress when she was discovered years earlier (“A Secret She Kept”).At the train station, Count Ipolitov recognizes Anya as Anastasia and kisses her hand. As they board the train to Paris, Count Ipolitov leads everyone in a prayer of farewell to Russia (“Stay, I Pray You”). During the train ride, Anya, Dmitry, and Vlad reflect on what they hope to accomplish in Paris: Anya hoping to discover that she is actually Anastasia, Dmitry's desire for the money, and Vlad hoping to win back Countess Lily Malevsky-Malevitch (""Sophie"" in the 1997 animated film), the Dowager Empress's lady-in-waiting with whom he had an affair (“We’ll Go From There”). Count Ipolitov is fatally shot by the police for illegally boarding the train. The police officers then go after Anya, Dmitry, and Vlad since they are wanted criminals in Russia, but they all jump off the train, narrowly avoiding capture.As they travel across Russia by foot, Gleb receives orders to follow Anya and kill her if she is the real Anastasia (“Traveling Sequence”). Gleb agrees to the task, but he realizes that he is in love with Anya and questions his heart (""Still""). Anya, Vlad, and Dmitry finally arrive in France, and as they travel to Paris, Anya summons the courage to continue on with the hope that she will finally discover who she is (“Journey to the Past”). Act II Anya, Vlad, and Dmitry arrive in Paris and are swept up by the sights and sounds of the city (“Paris Holds the Key (to Your Heart)”). When Vlad and Dmitry go off on their own, Anya visits the Pont Alexandre III bridge, named after Anastasia's grandfather, and she feels a strong connection to it (“Crossing a Bridge”).Now a bitter, elderly woman, Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna reads the letters of various Anastasia impersonators and, heartbroken, gives up hope of finding Anastasia (“Close the Door”). As Gleb arrives in Paris, Lily parties at the Neva Club, where rich and noble Russians reminisce about the old Russia (“Land of Yesterday”). Lily is reunited with Vlad, with whom she is angry for stealing her jewelry when they were lovers. The two rekindle their scandalous romance, and Vlad convinces her to let Anya meet the Dowager Empress at the ballet the next week (“The Countess and the Common Man”). However, Vlad accidentally drops the ballet tickets and Gleb, overhearing their plans, picks up their tickets (“Land of Yesterday” Reprise).At the hotel, Anya has a nightmare about the execution of the Romanovs (“A Nightmare”). Dmitry comforts her and recounts a story of how he bowed to Anastasia at a parade as a young boy. Anya vividly remembers this, and the two realize that Anya is indeed the Grand Duchess Anastasia (“In a Crowd of Thousands”).At the ballet, Vlad suspects that Anya and Dmitry are falling in love and is heartbroken that the two can never be together (“Meant to Be”). During the performance of “Swan Lake”, Anya sees the Dowager Empress and remembers her. The Dowager Empress also sees Anya and recognizes her, but clings to denial. Dmitry and Gleb (who is conflicted about whether or not to shoot Anya) reflect on their romantic feelings (“Quartet at the Ballet”).After the ballet, Lily also recognizes Anya as Anastasia and immediately takes her to the Dowager Empress. Dmitry is anxious about the meeting and realizes that he is in love with Anya, but knows he must let her go to her family (“Everything to Win”). Anya leaves the meeting enraged, having learned from the Dowager Empress that Vlad and Dmitry intended to use her in their scheme for money. As she storms off, Dmitry waits for the Dowager Empress. Marie coldly dismisses him, but Dmitry disrespectfully stops her. He begs her to see Anya, but she refuses again.Back at their hotel, Anya starts her packing, but she is interrupted by the Dowager Empress who, impressed by Dmitry's courage, has come to give her an opportunity. Anya is shocked by the Dowager Empress's cruelty, asserting that she isn't the nana that Anya remembered. The Dowager Empress angrily questions Anya about her past and the Romanov family, but Anya compels her to reflect on the person she has become over last two decades. Anya suddenly remembers the night that the Dowager Empress left her for Paris. When Anya produces the music box and sings the lullaby, the Dowager Empress finally realizes that Anya really is Anastasia and the two embrace, now reunited after twenty years (“Once Upon a December Reprise”).A press conference is held the next morning where Vlad and Lily try to fend off the hungry reporters (“The Press Conference”). Before appearing in public, the Dowager Empress tells Anya that Dmitry did not take the reward after all and reveals her respect for him. Anya expresses misgivings about her future life as a princess, and the Dowager Empress insists that no matter what she chooses, they'll always be together. Anya runs off to think; she realizes that she is in love with Dmitry, and decides that she must go after him (“Everything to Win Reprise”). As she turns to leave, Anya sees that Gleb has slipped in and locked them in the room. She realizes why he is there, and Gleb says that he must kill her to complete his father's mission. Anya now clearly remembers the day her family was killed and, without fear, taunts him to kill her so that she can be with her family. Overcome with emotion and not willing to bear the shame of his father, Gleb is unable to kill Anya (“Still/The Neva Flows Reprise”). Anya comforts Gleb, and they call a truce.Vlad, Lily, and the palace staff search for Anya, and the Dowager Empress is joyful, knowing that Anya is now where she belongs. She and Gleb announce to their people that the rumors of Anastasia will now cease; the reward for finding her will be donated to charity. Anya discovers Dmitry at Pont Alexandre III where they embrace. The couple leaves Paris as the spirits of the Romanovs celebrate the life that Anya and Dmitry will have together (“Finale”).","From the twilight of the Russian Empire to the euphoria of Paris in the 1920s, the new musical is the story of a brave young woman attempting to discover the mystery of her past while finding a place for herself in the rapidly changing world of a new century."
The Secret Garden," This synopsis describes the original Broadway production; the reworked London production altered this sequence by moving or omitting several scenes and songs. Act I Mary Lennox, a 10-year-old English girl who has lived in India since birth, dreams of English nursery rhymes and Hindi chants (""Opening""). She awakes to learn that her parents and nearly everyone she knew in India, including her Ayah, have died of cholera. Found by survivors of the epidemic (officers who worked alongside her father), Mary is sent back to England to live with her only remaining relations (""There's a Girl"").(Throughout the show, these and other songs are sung by a chorus of ghosts, referred to in the libretto as ""dreamers,"" who serve as narrators and Greek chorus for the action.)Her mother's sister, Lily, died many years ago. Lily's widower is Archibald Craven, a hunchback who is still overcome by grief. The management of his manor house, Misselthwaite, is largely left to his brother, Dr. Neville Craven. The house is haunted by ghosts (e.g. Lily, Ayah, Fakir, Rose, Albert Lennox, officers from India, etc.) and spirits of Archibald's and Mary's pasts, due to their holding on to what used to be. The housekeeper, Mrs. Medlock, coldly welcomes Mary to Yorkshire on her arrival (""The House Upon the Hill""). Mary has difficulty sleeping her first night there (""I Heard Someone Crying"") as she and Archibald both mourn their losses. The next morning, Mary meets Martha, a young chambermaid who encourages Mary to go play outside by telling her about the surrounding moorland and grounds (""If I Had a Fine White Horse""), in particular, a secret (hidden) garden. Meanwhile, Archibald remains submerged in his memories of Lily (""A Girl In the Valley""), while ghosts waltz to Lily's and Archibald's serenading.Mary explores the garden, laid out in Victorian style as a topiary maze, as do Ben Weatherstaff, an old gardener, and Martha's brother Dickon (""It's a Maze""), each with a different agenda. Ben tells Mary that the secret garden has been locked since Lily's death, as it reminds Archibald of her. Dickon invokes the spring (""Winter's On the Wing"") in a rustic druid-like fashion; he claims to converse with animals and teaches Mary to speak the Yorkshire dialect to an English robin (""Show Me the Key""). The bird leads Mary to the key for the garden, but does not show Mary the door.Archibald has a formal meeting with his niece, who asks him for a bit of earth (""A Bit of Earth"") to plant a garden of her own; he is startled and compares her to Lily for their shared horticultural interests. As the Yorkshire gloom turns to rain and ""Shakes the souls of the dead"" (""Storm I""), Archibald and his brother Neville both notice that Mary also physically resembles her aunt, with whom both men were in love. (""Lily's Eyes"")As the rain continues, Mary again hears someone crying (""Storm II""), but this time she finds the source: her cousin Colin, confined to bed since his birth, when his mother Lily died. He has been in bed his entire life because Archibald feared that Colin would also become a hunchback. In reality, Colin's spine is perfectly fine but his father is convinced that he has passed on his curse. Colin confides in his cousin his dreams of (""A Round-Shouldered Man"") who comes to him at night and reads to him from his book ""of all that's good and true"". However, just as it seems they have become friends, Neville and Mrs. Medlock burst in and dismiss her angrily, telling her she is never to see Colin again. As the storm reaches its peak, Mary runs outside and finds the door to the garden (""Final Storm""). Act II Mary has a reverie about (""The Girl I Mean to Be,"") with ""a place I can go when I am lost."" In reality, the garden is like her uncle and Mary herself, neglected and half-wild.Archibald relates a dream to Neville about seeing Lily and Mary together in the garden. But Neville's dreams are darker: recalling his unrequited love for Lily, Neville wants Archibald to leave Misselthwaite entirely to him. The two brothers' musings are interwoven with ghostly echoes of old arguments between Lily and her sister Rose (Mary's mother) about Archibald's suitability as a prospective husband and father (""Quartet""). At Neville's urging, Archibald leaves for the Continent, pausing only to read a fairy tale to Colin as the boy sleeps (""Race You To the Top of the Morning"").Mary asks Dickon for help with the garden, which appears dead; Dickon explains that it is probably just dormant and that ""somewhere there's a single streak of green inside it"" (""Wick""). Mary tells Colin about the discovered garden, but he is initially reluctant to go outside until encouraged by a vision of his mother (""Come to My Garden/Lift Me Up""). Mary, Dickon, and Martha clandestinely bring Colin to the garden in a wheelchair. In the garden, the exercise and fresh air begin to make Colin well (""Come Spirit, Come Charm""). The dreamers sing the praises of the renewed garden (""A Bit of Earth (Reprise)"").Back in the house, Mary faces down Neville as he threatens to send her away to boarding school. Martha tells Mary she must (""Hold On"")—""when you see a man who's ragin'/And he's jealous and he fears/That you've walked through walls he's hid behind for years..."" Mary writes to Archibald (""Letter Song"") urging him to come home.At first Archibald feels defeated and frustrated (""Where In the World""), but Lily's ghost convinces him to return (""How Could I Ever Know""). Entering the garden, he finds Colin completely healthy; in fact, he is beating Mary in a footrace as Archibald walks through the door.  Archibald, a changed man, accepts Mary as his own, and the dreamers invite all to ""stay here in the garden,"" as Lily and Mary's parents Albert and Rose promise to look over them for the rest of their days (""Finale""). Changes from the original novel Burnett's novel primarily focused on Mary and her interactions with Colin, Martha, and Dickon. The musical adds more emphasis to the adult characters by presenting (and to some extent, inventing) the shared history entwining the two families. Originally, Burnett stated that the name of Archibald's wife was Lilias, and that she was the sister of Mary Lennox's father; in the musical, Colin's and Mary's mothers are sisters named Lily and Rose respectively.In the book, Colin's private physician is an otherwise unnamed poor cousin of Archibald Craven; Colin privately remarks to Mary that Dr. Craven is the next heir to Misselthwaite and ""always looks cheerful when [Colin's health] is worse"", but Burnett also states that Dr. Craven is ""not an unscrupulous man, though he was a weak one, and he did not intend to let [Colin] run into actual danger."" The musical tightens the doctor's conflict of interest and makes him the primary antagonist as Archibald's brother, Dr. Neville Craven, who once hopelessly loved Lily and whom Mary expressly accuses of wanting Colin to die for the sake of his inheritance.","The young Englishwoman Mary lived in India from birth. When she was 10 years old, her parents died of cholera. All children that she knew also died. Soon, Mary was sent to relatives in England. Her aunt Lily had died many years ago, but her widower Archibald agreed to take the girl. He still has not agreed with the loss of his beloved wife. All deals of Archibald’s estate were managed by his brother Dr. Neville. Arriving in England, Mary was struck by the cold reception of the housekeeper. In the first night, the girl has not been able to sleep since she heard someone’s crying. In the morning, she asked the maid to tell her about the surrounding terrain. She said that near the estate there was a secret garden, and advised Mary to play outside. At the same time, Archibald recalled his dear Lily.  Being acquainted with the gardener Ben and brother of Martha, Dickon, a girl began to learn to communicate with animals and birds. She learned that in the labyrinth of the usual garden was hidden the secret area. This place was very fond of Lily, and after her death, the owner ordered the close its entrance. Having followed the bird, Mary found the key to the secret garden, but where was its door, she did not find out. Soon, the girl met Archibald and his brother. She asked permission to plant her own garden plot. The owner was amazed – his former wife also liked to grow trees and plants. Archibald and Neville noticed that Mary was very similar to her aunt – she had Lily's eyes. Left in the building because of the rain, the girl once again heard someone crying. Going to the sound, she met her cousin, Colin.  Boy was bedridden since birth – right after the death of his mother. His father was in the belief that his son inherited his defect of appearance. But Archibald was wrong. Spine of Colin was healthy and hump had not appeared. The boy shared a secret with the girl – at night to him came a hunchback man and read books to him. When the children became friends, into the room burst Dr. Neville and housekeeper. They forbade Mary to visit Colin. Running out in the middle of a storm on the street, the girl found an entrance to the secret garden’s area. Seeing a beautiful place in bad condition, she realized that she could find here what she was striving for in her life. At this time, the brothers recalled Lily – Neville was secretly in love with the wife of Archibald. The doctor advised the family member to travel to the continent for the rest. After reading a story to his son at night, the father hit the road.  Mary asked Dickon to help her take care of the secret garden. Soon the trees and shrubs regained their former beauty. The girl told her cousin about this place. At first, Colin was afraid to appear on the street, but when he saw the ghost of his mother, who encouraged him, the boy agreed to visit the secret area. Mary, Dickon and Martha moved the child in a wheelchair, to set him in the garden. Thanks to the fresh air and exercises, Colin began to feel better. When Mary returned to the house, Neville began to threaten her – he did not want the boy's recovery. The doctor said the girl would be sent to a boarding school. After that, a girl wrote a letter to father of Colin asking him to return home. After receiving the letter and meeting the ghost of Lily, Archibald arrived back in England. Going into the secret garden, father saw that his son might already run. Thus, he realized Mary’s help and began to treat her as his own daughter."

Assassins," This synopsis reflects the current licensed version of the show. The published script of the 1992 Off-Broadway production is slightly different.The show opens in a fairground shooting gallery where, amid flashing lights, human figures trundle past on a conveyor belt. One by one, a collection of misfits enters the stage, where the Proprietor of the game entices them to play, promising that their problems will be solved by killing a President (""Everybody’s Got the Right""). Leon Czolgosz, John Hinckley, Charles Guiteau, Giuseppe Zangara, Samuel Byck, Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme, and Sara Jane Moore are given their guns one by one. John Wilkes Booth enters last and the Proprietor introduces him to the others as their pioneer before he begins distributing ammunition. The assassins take aim as ""Hail to the Chief"" heralds Abraham Lincoln's offstage arrival. Booth excuses himself, a shot rings out and Booth shouts, ""Sic semper tyrannis!""The Balladeer, a personification of the American Dream, appears and begins to tell John Wilkes Booth's story (""The Ballad of Booth""). The scene changes to Richard H. Garrett's barn in 1865. Booth, mudstained and with a broken leg, is attempting to write his reasons for killing Lincoln in his diary but cannot hold the pen. He forces his associate David Herold to write for him at gunpoint. As Booth dictates, blaming Lincoln for the Civil War and for destroying the South, the Balladeer interjects that Booth's motives really had more to do with his personal problems. When a Union soldier calls for Booth's surrender, Herold abandons him and surrenders. In desperation, Booth throws the Balladeer his diary so that he can tell his story to the world. The Balladeer reads out Booth's justifications, and Booth laments that the act for which he has given up his life will not be enough to heal the country. As the Union soldiers set fire to the barn, Booth commits suicide, and the Balladeer concludes that Booth was a madman whose treacherous legacy only served as inspiration for other madmen like him to damage the country. The Balladeer rips Booth's rationale from his diary and burns the pages.The Assassins gather in a bar. Guiteau toasts to the Presidency of the United States, speaking of his ambition to become Ambassador to France. Zangara complains about his stomach pains, and Booth suggests fixing them by shooting Franklin D. Roosevelt. Hinckley accidentally breaks a bottle, and Czolgosz flies into a rage, describing the horrors he sees in the bottle factory he works in, and how many men die or are injured just to make a bottle like the one Hinckley has just broken. Guiteau jokingly tells Czolgosz to find another job, and the two begin to argue about the American Dream, with Guiteau defending America and Czolgosz dismissing the ""land of opportunity"" as a lie. Czolgosz becomes enraged and grabs a bottle, barely stopping himself from throwing it across the room. Booth urges Czolgosz to take control of his fate by breaking a bottle himself, but Czolgosz cannot.A radio broadcast, narrated by the Proprietor, describes Zangara's failed attempt to assassinate Roosevelt. He misses Roosevelt and accidentally kills Chicago Mayor Anton Cermak instead. Five Bystanders are interviewed in turn, telling the audience their personal versions of the event; each is convinced that he or she personally saved the President (""How I Saved Roosevelt""). From an electric chair, Zangara sings his refusal to be afraid and that he hadn't cared whom he killed as long as it was one of the men who control the money. Peeved that as an ""American Nothing"" he has no photographers at his execution, Zangara is electrocuted as the Bystanders preen for the cameras.American anarchist leader Emma Goldman gives a lecture from offstage as Leon Czolgosz listens, enraptured. He introduces himself to her and declares his love, but she tells him to redirect his passion to the fight for social justice. She gives him a leaflet that she tells him contains an idea that is ""not mine alone, but mine"". As she prepares to leave, Czolgosz offers to carry her bag, to which Goldman protests by saying, ""They make us servants, Leon. We do not make servants of each other."" Czolgosz, in his first display of assertiveness, still insists.Fromme and Moore meet on a park bench and share a joint. Fromme speaks of the apocalyptic preachings of mass murderer Charles Manson, remembering how they met and declaring herself his lover and slave. Juggling her purse, a can of Tab and a bucket of Kentucky Fried Chicken, Moore claims she is an informant for the FBI (or used to be), has been a CPA and had five husbands and three children. They connect over their shared hatred of their fathers, and using Colonel Sanders as a graven image, they give the bucket of chicken the evil eye and then shoot it to pieces while laughing hysterically. Moore realizes that she had known Manson in high school, and the scene ends as the women scream in delight over their memories of the charismatic killer.Czolgosz reflects on how many men die in the mines, the steel mills and the factories just to make a gun. Booth, Guiteau and Moore enter one by one and join him in a barbershop quartet in which they honor a single gun's power to change the world (""The Gun Song""). Czolgosz decides his gun will claim one more victim: the President.Czolgosz arrives at the 1901 Pan-American Exposition and sees that William McKinley is shaking visitors' hands in the Temple of Music Pavilion. The Balladeer sings ""The Ballad of Czolgosz"" as Czolgosz joins the receiving line, and upon reaching McKinley, he shoots him.Samuel Byck sits on a park bench in a dirty Santa suit with a picket sign and a shopping bag. He talks into a tape recorder, preparing a message to Leonard Bernstein telling Bernstein he can save the world by writing more love songs, and explaining that he is going to change things by crashing a 747 into the White House and killing Richard Nixon. Then he accuses Bernstein of ignoring him, just like the other celebrities he has recorded tapes for, such as Hank Aaron and Jonas Salk. After flying into an expletive-laden rage, Byck stands up on the bench and angrily sings the chorus to West Side Story's song ""America"" before storming offstage.John Hinckley sits in his rumpus room, aimlessly playing a guitar. Lynette Fromme enters and tries to convince him to play her a song (asking for ""Helter Skelter""), but he refuses. Fromme notices a picture of Jodie Foster, who Hinckley claims is his girlfriend. When Fromme realizes the picture is a publicity photo from a film, she pulls out a picture of Charles Manson and mocks Hinckley for being in love with a woman he's never met, which makes him throw her out in a fit of rage. Alone, he swears that he will win Foster's love ""with one brave, historic act"" and sings a love song to her while Fromme individually does the same to Manson (""Unworthy of Your Love""). An image of Ronald Reagan appears on a wall in the back of the stage, and an enraged Hinckley shoots it over and over again, but the picture keeps reappearing. The Proprietor mocks Hinckley by quoting Reagan's famous quips about the assassination as Hinckley fires and fires, missing each time.Back at the Proprietor's shooting range, Charles Guiteau flirts with Sara Jane Moore while giving her marksmanship tips before trying to kiss her. When she rebuffs him, he becomes suddenly enraged and attempts to attack her. Her gun goes off in his ear, and he backs off, angrily proclaiming that he is extraordinary and will be the next Ambassador to France. The scene changes to a train station, where Guiteau goes to meet James Garfield. He asks to be made Ambassador to France, but Garfield mockingly refuses, prompting Guiteau to shoot him.Guiteau is arrested and sent to the gallows, where he recites a poem he wrote that morning titled ""I am Going to the Lordy"". When Guiteau finishes, the Balladeer enters and sings about Guiteau's trial and sentencing while Guiteau merrily cakewalks up to the noose, getting more and more desperately optimistic with each verse. Guiteau sings along with the Balladeer about Guiteau's optimism before he is finally hanged (""The Ballad of Guiteau"").Squeaky Fromme and Sara Jane Moore prepare to assassinate Gerald Ford. Moore has brought along her nine-year-old son and her dog (which she accidentally shoots), which causes an argument between the two women, who briefly turn on each other. Moore accidentally spills her gun's bullets just as President Ford enters the stage. Not recognizing him at first, the two women allow him to help them, but upon discovering who he is, Fromme tries to shoot him, but her gun jams. Having no other resource left, Moore tries to throw her bullets at Ford, shouting ""bang"" as she does so.Samuel Byck is driving to the airport to hijack a plane, which he plans to crash into the White House. Growing completely unhinged, he records a message addressed to Richard Nixon, complaining about contemporary American life, how the American public is constantly lied to, and announces that killing him is the only solution.The assassins congregate in the Proprietor's shooting range once again and enumerate their reasons for taking action. Led by Byck, they lament that they haven't gotten the rewards they were ""promised"". The Balladeer tells them that their actions didn't solve their problems or the country's and that if they want their prizes they must follow the American Dream. The assassins realize that they will never get their prizes, that no one will ever care if they live or die, and briefly sink into absolute desperation until Byck and the Proprietor lead them in ""Another National Anthem,"" a song for all Americans dispossessed by the dream. The Balladeer attempts to convince them to be optimistic and seek other ways to be happy, but the Anthem grows louder and louder until the assassins force the Balladeer offstage (in the 2004 revival and many productions that followed, the Assassins all surround the Balladeer, transforming him into Lee Harvey Oswald).The scene changes to the sixth floor of the Texas School Book Depository. The ghosts of John Wilkes Booth, Leon Czolgosz, Charles Guiteau, and the other ""would be"" assassins including John Hinckley, Giuseppe Zangara, Samuel Byck, Lynette ""Squeaky"" Fromme, and Sara Jane Moore, appear before a suicidally depressed Lee Harvey Oswald, and convince him that the only way for him to truly connect with his country is to share his pain and disillusionment with it. They slowly and carefully attempt to convince him not to become his own victim and to instead assassinate John F. Kennedy. Booth tells Oswald that by joining them he will finally make a difference, but Oswald refuses. Booth tells him that in the future, when Hinckley's room is searched, Oswald's biographies will be found. Booth tells Oswald that the key to the future is in his hands. Oswald tries to leave, but Zangara addresses him passionately in Italian, his words translated by the other assassins, imploring him to act so their own acts can come alive again. They tell him that he has the power to cause worldwide grief and inspire global passion about himself, a man the world has never cared or heard about. Calling themselves his family, the assassins sing, imploring Oswald to act. He crouches at the window and shoots (""November 22, 1963"").After the assassinations, a group of citizens recount what they were doing when they heard that the President had been killed and lament that even though only a single man died, the nation has changed forever (""Something Just Broke"").The assassins regroup once more at the shooting range, now with Oswald among their ranks, and they proudly restate their motto, ""Everybody's got the right to be happy,"" before loading their guns and opening fire on the audience (""Everybody's Got the Right (Reprise)"").","The play about the people who killed several different people, including couple of presidents of USA, among which is Lincoln. One of them, John Wilkes Booth, during the course of the play was depicted as insane, who, above any lofty motives for the murder, just wanted to harm his country and disrupt its social structure. Yes, he was not used to changes, and they became so numerous during the civil war that the mind of the little man could not bear it.  One of the assassins, who tried to kill Roosevelt, killed another person in his place – the mayor of the city – and did not repent of his deeds. On the contrary, he was glad that he had killed someone, ""who controls the money"". According to him, it was good. Being executed on the electric chair, he no longer preached his vile ideas.  The next killer talked about anarchy, and what, in his opinion, may be called as ""social justice"". Their minions talk about the human qualities of Charles Manson, enjoying their own vices. Some of them knew Charles at school. And someone uses posters with Colonel Sanders as a target in a shooting gallery, only shoot him with martial bullets.  Gradually, with the increase of a degree of discontent with communal system in which they live, those who show us through a series of scenes on the stage, get the audience to the fact that they all converge to the murder of the president of USA as the only viable solution. One of these fanatics kills President McKinley.  In the play, we also meet inhumane Lee Harvey Oswald, who is considered almost a god be participants. But what amazes truly, happens at the end of the show – all on the scene charge their guns and shoot at the audience."
Porgy and Bess," Set in the early 1900s in the fictional Catfish Row section of Charleston, South Carolina, which serves as home to a black fishing community, the story focuses on the title characters: crippled beggar Porgy, who travels about in a goat-drawn cart, and the drug-addicted Bess, who lives with stevedore Crown, the local bully. While high on cocaine supplied by Sportin' Life, Crown kills Robbins after the latter vanquishes him in a craps game; Bess urges Crown to flee. Sportin' Life suggests she accompany him to New York City, an offer Bess declines. She seeks refuge with her neighbors, all of whom refuse to help her. Porgy finally agrees to let her stay with him.Bess and Porgy settle into domestic life together and soon fall in love. Just before a church picnic on Kittiwah Island, Sportin' Life once again approaches Bess, but Porgy warns him to leave her alone. Bess wishes to stay with Porgy, since he cannot attend the picnic because of his disability, but he urges her to go. After the picnic ends, and before Bess can leave, Crown, who has been hiding in the woods on the island, confronts her. She initially struggles to resist him but Crown rapes her. The others, not knowing exactly what has happened, leave and return to the mainland.Two days later, Bess returns to Catfish Row in a state of delirium. When she recovers, she remembers what happened. Feeling that she betrayed Porgy, she begs his forgiveness. She admits she is unable to resist Crown  and asks Porgy to protect her from him. Crown eventually returns to claim his woman, and when he draws his knife, Porgy strangles him. He is detained by the police merely to identify the body, but Sportin' Life, who has fed Bess cocaine, convinces her Porgy inadvertently will reveal himself to be the murderer. In her drugged state, she finally accepts his offer to take her to New York. When Porgy returns and discovers she is gone, he sets off to find her.", 
Finding Neverland, ,"The story is a mixture of fairy tale about Peter Pan and description of life of the Scottish writer J. M. Barrie, who created this story, based on his surroundings and acquaintances.  Barrie meets the widowed woman named Sylvia, who has four children, and she has to raise them alone after her husband's death from cancer. As Barrie and his wife don’t have children, so he, being a child in the soul, actively plays with them from the heart. As well he becomes a very caring person to his new girlfriend. Barrie's wife against such a pastime, as well as mother of Sylvia, a woman of strict views and wanting to control everything in the life of her daughter. After some time, Sylvia begins to wither from an unknown illness and Barrie's wife leaves him, protesting his affair on the side. Barrie at the same time develops the basis for his novel, calling it Peter Pan, after one of the boys of Sylvia, fidget Peter, who does not want to grow up and to whom he has a strong attachment. Surname “Pan”, he could take based on following meaning of it word: ""to give it hot and strong"" or from other word, ""pun"".  This writer wants to develop a play based on a new idea, but does not want it to fall into the same sharp criticism, as well as his previous, unsuccessful work. The director of the play, Mr. Frohman, extremely reluctantly takes it into production because he does not believe that the rich theatergoers will attend it. At the first exhibition, Barrie led there many children from orphanages and they infect surrounding people with their delight and simply melted their hearts, so the play became terribly successful. Peter attended a play and realized that it was made based on the life of his family. Barrie decided to make a personal spectacle to his beloved Sylvia, who cannot visit it in the theater, because of being terminally ill, and she is too weak to walk. He brought the actors, make-up and costumes to her house, and in the final stage, her children helped her to enter into another room under the guise of that it was a Neverland. In the next scene, the viewer sees the funeral of Sylvia after her death. The statement of her last will contained an indication for Barrie to take care of her children as they agreed before.  Peter sitting on a bench reading a script of Peter Pan, in the same place where they had met with Barrie for the first time and the latter comforts Peter, exhorting him that the life goes on."
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang, ,"Children of inventor named Caractacus Potts are the principal characters here. He was not very lucky in the inventions, as well as in his second path – investments. Periodically tries to invent something to sell his ideas, wherever he can, but he was not lucky. His automatic hairdressing machine suddenly did very ugly cuts out of hair of the angry client at the local fair. His sweet caramel whistles, as it turns out, has attracted not only with its whistle, but also dogs from all the neighborhood. Or when he was trying to dance, he almost destroyed the whole dance. The unlucky man, if to put in two words.  It happened so that one of the vehicles – cars – was for a long time in the garage of the inventor and his children grow up on a farm where this garage was standing. Their father was not the owner of the remnants of the car, and a ragpicker-usurer wanted to purchase it as scrap metal, but children resist it. Once they have been found as they played hooky by a beautiful baroness with a funny name Truly Scrumptious (“very excellent”, it may be translated). She brought them home at her car to his father and was very interested in inventions of Caractacus, as well as in his car. It turned out that it was not a simple car. It once constantly won a bunch of racing competitions, but one day went into a ditch and was on fire, and its stuff somehow migrated here. The audience also learns that there is an evil ruler of the fictional country Vulgaria (it seems to us, is has derived from the name of the country Bulgaria, but assuming from a variety of other sources, this version requires confirmation). In this country, citizens speak on a mixture of English, German and French, and it is located somewhere in Europe. It has evil rulers who send their agents to track down and to steal this in the past racing car. They did not succeed, but steal Caractacus and his father, and the children of Caractacus run after him. Along the way, they managed to destroy the evil state system of Vulgaria, freed the local citizens from the bad kings, they jailed their rulers & exiled them afterwards, and safely got themselves back home. While it appears that the racing car can fly and float, making this cute story to be a fairy tale.  Caractacus Potts successfully sells one of his inventions – a sweet whistle – to a local chocolate baron and becomes rich, marry Truly Scrumptious, because there are feeling between them for a long time."
The 25th Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee," The musical begins with Rona Lisa Peretti entering the gymnasium to set up. As she passes by the microphone, she has a flashback to the moment when she won the third annual spelling bee by correctly spelling syzygy. The spellers are introduced as they enter, and sing about their anticipation of the bee (""The Twenty-Fifth Annual Putnam County Spelling Bee""). Rona then welcomes the audience to the bee, and calls the selected 4 audience spellers to the stage. She also speaks privately to Olive Ostrovsky, who has not yet paid the entrance fee of twenty-five dollars. When asked if she has a parent in the audience who can pay, Olive reveals that she has arrived by herself on the bus. Rona decides to let the fee slide for the moment. She then introduces the official word pronouncer, Douglas Panch, who is returning from a five-year hiatus. Panch alludes to an incident five years ago, but declares that he is in a better place now. Panch introduces the intimidating-looking comfort counselor, Mitch Mahoney, who is helping at the Bee as part of his court-mandated community service. Mahoney leads the spellers (now including the audience volunteers) in the Pledge of Allegiance.  Panch then explains the rules of the spelling bee (""The Spelling Rules / My Favorite Moment of the Bee 1"").The spelling bee begins and as each non-audience speller is called forward, the audience learns about his or her background through flashbacks (with other characters in the flashbacks being played by the other spellers on stage, including simple nonspeaking roles played by the audience spellers, as guided by the actors).Logainne Schwartzandgrubenierre is called up first.When Leaf Coneybear is called to spell the first time, it is revealed in a flashback that he came in third at his regional bee, but advanced to the county finals when the winner and runner-up had to attend the winner's Bat Mitzvah. His word is capybara, which he has no idea how to spell, but he ends up spelling it correctly while in a trance. Olive is shown to be shy and reserved, a result of her largely absent parents — her mother is in India on a spiritual journey, and her father is missing the bee to work, late as usual. She has come to love spelling by reading the dictionary in her home (""My Friend, the Dictionary"").An audience volunteer is called up, and is given an easy word. If they get it correct, the 2nd volunteer then gets a hard word intended to eliminate them. If the first volunteer gets their word wrong, then the 2nd is given an easy word or not called at all.When William Barfée is called to spell for the first time, Rona describes his unusual technique — he spells the word out on the ground with his foot to get a visual before speaking it. He demonstrates his confidence by returning to his seat immediately after spelling his word, and responding ""I know"" when Panch affirms that the spelling is correct.The 3rd volunteer is given an easy word (often ""Mexican""), which the spellers complain about. After several rounds, another particularly easy word is given to the final audience speller (often ""cow"", ""telephone"" or ""hospital""), and the spellers erupt and rant about how the element of luck makes the bee unfair (""Pandemonium"").Logainne then gets ""Cystitis,"" and is shown studying with her two often-arguing fathers in a flashback.When Leaf is called the second time, he is given acouchi, which he again does not know how to spell. He reminisces about how his family repeatedly calls him ""dumb"", a sentiment that he has come to believe. Again, in a trance, he spells the word correctly (""I'm Not That Smart"").Barfée is called, and this time sings about his technique (""Magic Foot"").When Marcy is called again, she correctly spells an extraordinarily difficult word (""qaimaqam""), proving herself to be the best speller. However, she is genuinely surprised and somewhat hurt when Rona claims that she is ""all business"".Chip Tolentino is called next, but he is not paying attention. Rather, he is fantasizing about Leaf's attractive sister, Marigold, in the audience. When snapped out of his daze, he is reluctant to take his turn because he has an erection that is showing. Under threat of disqualification, he takes his turn, but his thoughts (aided by the vaguely erotic word that he is given, tittup) distract him and he begins to misspell the word. He catches himself quickly, and backs up to try to save himself, but the rules of the bee state that ""the sequences of letters already spoken may not be changed"". He begs for another chance, but Mitch eventually hauls him off (""Pandemonium (Reprise) / My Favorite Moment of the Bee 2"").At this point, the last audience speller is eliminated (he or she simply is called repeatedly in succession and given increasingly difficult words). Mitch sings a special serenade to this audience member for making it this far (""Prayer of the Comfort Counselor"").The remaining spellers (all of the normal cast spellers except for Chip) and the adults go on break, and Chip passes through the audience selling snacks, the punishment for being the first eliminated. He explains to the audience why he lost (""My Unfortunate Erection (Chip's Lament)""). Barfée taunts Chip, who throws a bag of peanut M&M's at him. Barfée is allergic to peanuts, so Olive picks them up for him. Chip and Barfée continue to fight before Rona escorts the former offstage. Olive and Barfée converse awkwardly before the second half of the bee begins, and Barfée begins to develop a crush on Olive.With the break over, Rona introduces the finalists as they reenter. Last to be introduced is Logainne, who describes her two overbearing fathers and the stress that they put on her (""Woe is Me""). In a montage sequence, the bee is shown progressing through many rounds, ending with Leaf’s elimination on the word chinchilla. He walks away head held high, having proven to himself, despite his elimination, that he is smart (I'm Not that Smart (Reprise)"").Marcy is called to spell, and Rona, who has been announcing factoids about the spellers all along, announces that Marcy speaks five languages. Marcy reveals more about her stressful life, where she is pushed to succeed in everything, which she does not enjoy (""I Speak Six Languages""). She is given the word camouflage, to which she sighs, ""Dear Jesus, can't you come up with a harder word than that?"" Jesus then appears to her and teaches her that she is in control of her own life. Resolved to do what she wants rather than what is expected of her, she intentionally misspells the word and exits excitedly (""Jesus / Pandemonium (Reprise #2)"").Olive's cellphone rings — it is her father, who she has been anxiously hoping would arrive. Panch attempts to disallow her from answering the phone, but she persuades Rona to take the call for her. Logainne then begins an ad-libbed rant about the bee, her fathers, and current political events. Panch, provoked by the rant and upset that he has lost control over the bee, loses his temper and lashes out at Logainne, who is next up to spell. Panch is then escorted offstage by Rona and Mitch (different productions handle this differently). One of Logainne's fathers jumps onstage to calm Logainne down, and, despite his daughter's protests, pours some of his soda on the floor to make Barfée's foot stick and thus disrupt his technique.With Panch calmed down, Olive is called to spell. She asks what her father had said, and is saddened to learn that he said he is running even later than planned. Her word is chimerical, and mirroring the word's definition, she imagines her parents being there and giving her the love that she always has wanted and yearned for, while showing the problems with her own family (""The I Love You Song"").Barfée is called to spell next, and when he uses his signature technique, the soda causes his foot to stick. Much to his surprise, he is able to spell his word correctly anyway. Logainne is next, and she overcomplicates her word vug and misspells it (""Woe is Me (Reprise)""). Rona is excited that it has come down to the final two (""My Favorite Moment of the Bee 3"").The finals are shown through another montage (""Second""), and Olive and Barfée continue to grow closer. Eventually, Olive misspells a word (elanguescence), giving Barfée a chance to win by spelling his next word correctly. He is torn between winning and letting Olive win, but with Olive's encouragement, he spells his word correctly (Weltanschauung). Panch awards William Morris Barfée the trophy and two hundred dollar prize, and in a surprise act of charity, gives Olive a fictitious runner-up prize of twenty-five dollars from his own pocket — exactly the amount needed to cover her entrance fee. Olive congratulates and hugs Barfée, and each character reads their epilogue, a sentence or two about what they do in the years and decades after the main action of the play ends (""Finale"").","School gymnasium was prepared for the finals of the regional competition for the best spelling and pronunciation. Young participants have started to be registered by the former winner of the world championship Miss Rona Lisa Peretti. Olive had problems with the payment of the participation fee, but the girl was met well when she said that her father would bring the required amount by the end of the contest. Soon Douglas Panch announced participants spelling rules that they must follow. 10-year-old Logainne Schwarzandsrubeniere started the competition first. Girl has successfully coped with the task, and then the organizers called Leaf Coneybear. Struck not only himself but also his family, the boy successfully wrote the word without knowing its meaning. Olive was forced to abort assignment to protect the empty chair prepared for her father. Chip Tolentino was thinking of other things like pretty girls, and therefore could not write a word correctly. Following an internal impulse, Leaf has successfully completed a new assignment, not knowing again what it was. William Barffe had a special technique because of the disease – the boy wrote with his foot.  During the break, Chip was instructed to sell food – this was his punishment for the knockout. Starting a quarrel with William, he began to throw peanuts at him. Olive stood up for the boy, who had a severe allergy on peanuts. Embarrassed Barffe began to feel sympathy to her. After the start of the second round, participants continued competition. They went through a few levels without loss, but in the end, Leaf left their ranks. The finalists were four contenders for the title. A representative of Catholic school Marcy could not stand the stress and went off the distance. Logainne Schwarzandsrubeniere had a hysterics, and one of her parents rushed to the scene to calm their daughter. Under cover of this, man tried to hurt William Barffe and his wonderful foot. Rona Lisa Peretti received a message from Olive's father – he was delayed at work, so the question of the contribution would be decided later. Girl with difficulty kept the focus, learning the news. Suddenly William’s foot stuck to the floor. Fighting for participation in the contest, the boy realized that he could write with hand. Logainne dropped out of the competition, being too wise performing a simple task.  Only two members left at the end – Olive and William Barffe, who were nip and tuck. The girl and the boy began to experience a lot of sympathy to each other. For William, it was a new thing – he stopped to think about himself and his disease. Despite the good attitude to the opponent, the children realized that only one participant could win. The main prize went to Barffe – excited boy got $200. Despite the loss, Olive was happy for William, which significantly reduced the level of his concern due to her failure. Suddenly Douglas Panch announced – for the second place, it was decided to hand over the prize money too. It was enough for Olive to make a deferred payment for her participation in the competition. The girl had no idea that the man decided to help her and provided the required amount from his own purse. Actions of a colleague praised Rona Lisa Peretti, which pleased Panch very much."
A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum," In ancient Rome, some neighbors live in three adjacent houses. In the center is the house of Senex, who lives there with wife Domina, son Hero, and several slaves, including head slave Hysterium and the musical's main character Pseudolus. A slave belonging to Hero, Pseudolus wishes to buy, win, or steal his freedom. One of the neighboring houses is owned by Marcus Lycus, who is a buyer and seller of beautiful women; the other belongs to the ancient Erronius, who is abroad searching for his long-lost children (stolen in infancy by pirates).One day, Senex and Domina depart on a visit to Domina's mother and leave Pseudolus in charge of Hero. Hero confides in Pseudolus that he is in love with the lovely Philia, one of the courtesans in the House of Lycus (albeit still a virgin). Pseudolus promises to help him win Philia's love in exchange for his own freedom. Unfortunately (as the two find out when they pay a visit on Lycus), Philia has been sold to the renowned warrior Miles Gloriosus, who is expected to claim her very soon.  Pseudolus, an excellent liar, uses Philia's cheery disposition to convince Lycus that she has picked up a plague from Crete, which causes its victims to smile endlessly in its terminal stages. By offering to isolate her in Senex's house, he is able to give Philia and Hero some time alone together, and the two fall in love. But Philia insists that, even though she is in love with Hero, she must honor her contract with the Captain, for ""that is the way of a courtesan."" To appease her, he tells her to wait (""that's what virgins do best, isn't it?"") inside, and that he will have the captain knock three times when he arrives. Pseudolus comes up with a plan to slip Philia a sleeping potion that will render her unconscious. He will then tell Lycus that she has died of the Cretan plague, and will offer to remove the body. Hero will come along, and they will stow away on a ship headed for Greece. Satisfied with his plan, Pseudolus steals Hysterium's book of potions and has Hero read him the recipe for the sleeping potion; the only ingredient he lacks is ""mare's sweat"", and Pseudolus goes off in search of some.Unexpectedly, Senex returns home early from his trip, and knocks three times on his own door. Philia comes out of the house, and, thinking that Senex is the Captain, offers herself up to him. Surprised but game, Senex instructs Philia to wait in the house for him, and she does. Hysterium arrives to this confusion, and tells Senex that Philia is the new maid that he has hired. Pseudolus returns, having procured the necessary mare's sweat; seeing that Senex has returned unexpectedly and grasping the need to keep him out of the way, Pseudolus discreetly sprinkles some of the horse-sweat onto him, then suggests that the road trip has left Senex in dire need of a bath. Taking the bait, Senex instructs Hysterium to draw him a bath in the long-abandoned house of Erronius. But while this is happening, Erronius returns home, finally having given up the search for his long-lost children. Hysterium, desperate to keep him out of the house where his master is bathing, tells the old man that his house has become haunted – a story seemingly confirmed by the sound of Senex singing in his bath. Erronius immediately determines to have a soothsayer come and banish the spirit from his house, and Pseudolus obligingly poses as one, telling Erronius that, in order to banish the spirit, he must travel seven times around the seven hills of Rome (thus keeping the old man occupied and out of the way for quite a while).When Miles Gloriosus arrives to claim his courtesan-bride, Pseudolus hides Philia on the roof of Senex's house; told that she has ""escaped,"" Lycus is terrified to face the Captain's wrath. Pseudolus offers to impersonate Lycus and talk his way out of the mess but, his ingenuity flagging, he ends up merely telling the Captain that Philia has disappeared, and that he, ""Lycus"", will search for her. Displeased and suspicious, Miles insists that his soldiers accompany Pseudolus, but the wily slave loses them in Rome's winding streets.Complicating matters further, Domina returns from her trip early, suspicious that her husband Senex is ""up to something low."" She disguises herself in virginal white robes and a veil (much like Philia's) to try to catch Senex being unfaithful. Pseudolus convinces Hysterium to help him by dressing in drag and pretending to be Philia, ""dead"" from the plague. Unfortunately, it turns out that Miles Gloriosus has just returned from Crete, where there is of course no actual plague. With the ruse thus revealed, the main characters run for their lives, resulting in a madcap chase across the stage with both Miles and Senex pursuing all three ""Philia""s (Domina, Hysterium, and the actual Philia – all wearing identical white robes and veils). Meanwhile, the courtesans from the house of Marcus Lycus – who had been recruited as mourners at ""Philia""'s ersatz funeral – have escaped, and Lycus sends his eunuchs out to bring them all back, adding to the general pandemonium.Finally, the Captain's troops are able to round everyone up. His plot thoroughly unraveled, Pseudolus appears to be in deep trouble – but Erronius, completing his third circuit of the Roman hills, shows up fortuitously to discover that Miles Gloriosus and Philia are wearing matching rings which mark them as his long-lost children. Philia's betrothal to the Captain is nullified by the unexpected revelation that he's her brother, and, as the daughter of a free-born citizen, she's freed from Marcus Lycus. Philia weds Hero; Pseudolus gets his freedom and the lovely courtesan Gymnasia; Gloriosus receives twin courtesans to replace Philia; and Erronius is reunited with his children. A happy ending prevails for all – except for poor Senex, stuck with his shrewish wife Domina.","The plot revolves around a lazy slave named Pseudolus, yearning for his own freedom, and his young master Hero. Ancient Rome, three neighboring houses, one of which belongs to the Hero and his parents, Domina and Senex, the second – to Marcus Lycus, he is also the owner of a brothel, and the third – to an old crank Erronius, seeking for many years for his stolen children.  Madame Fate smiles to Pseudolus, and a young Hero opens to a servant once a secret: he is in love with the beautiful courtesan, young Philia that belongs to Lycus. A slave catches luck by the tail and offers his owner a deal: love of Philia in exchange for own freedom. So this dynamic and exciting history of love and fun begins.  Slave is sent to a brothel to convince Lycus to sell him the girl, but finds out that she has already has been bought by militant centurion Miles Gloriosus, to become his wife, and the transaction cannot be reverted. Quirky Pseudolus lying about that he sees plague’s symptoms on that girl, and offers to send her in isolation from the others, in the Senex and Domina’s house, which just went on a trip, because – what a luck! – he knows how to cure her. The owner of a brothel agrees and thus the servant wins alone with his master’s beloved a couple of days for him.  Cunning slave possesses quite a bit of time to figure out how to cancel a dubious marriage and to steal a freedom from a Fortune, but all his efforts are not in vain, even if it once seems that all the tricks and clever plans of slave have failed. After all, who would have thought that it was an old neighbor, who will be in the right place at the right time to recognize own child in a courtesan?"
The Pirates of Penzance," Frederic was sent in the care of his nursemaid, Ruth, to be apprenticed to a pilot. But she misunderstood her instructions, being hard of hearing, and apprenticed him instead to the Pirate King. Now turning 21 years old, his service is finished, so he decides to leave the Pirates of Penzance. Ruth wants him to take her with him, but he soon meets some young maidens, the daughters of Major-General Stanley, and realizes that Ruth is ""plain and old."" Frederic quickly falls in love with one of them, Mabel. He has a strong ""sense of duty"" and has vowed to lead a blameless life and to exterminate the pirates. Soon, however, the pirates return and seize the young ladies. Their father then arrives and lies to the pirates, telling them that he is an orphan. He knows that they are orphans themselves and never attack another orphan.After the pirates leave, General Stanley wrestles with his conscience, having told a lie. Mabel and Frederic try to cheer him up, and Frederic has engaged the constabulary to help him defeat the pirates. The police arrive, but they turn out to be timid. Then the pirate king and Ruth find Frederic alone. They have reviewed the fine print on his apprenticeship indenture and have discovered that he is still a pirate because he was born in leap year on February 29, and he will not be out of his indentures to the pirates until his 21st birthday. Mabel agrees to wait for Frederic until then. The Police return and, hearing the pirates approach, they hide. The pirates arrive and seize the still guilt-ridden Major-General. The police are coaxed to battle the pirates, but they are defeated. However, the Sergeant of Police calls on the pirates to ""yield in Queen Victoria's name."" The pirates tearfully do so and release the Major-General, surrendering to the police. However, Ruth reveals that the pirates are all ""noblemen who have gone wrong,"" and the Major-General pardons them and invites them to marry his daughters, as all ends happily.","On the shore of Cornwall, in the time of Queen Victoria's reign, the young boy Frederic is celebrating his 21st year of birth in the company of pirates. Concurrently, this day is the last day of a young man studying the pirate ‘mastership’, to which he was condemned by his own babysitter due to her poor hearing. She did not hear well the instructions of the dying young man's father & instead to make sure he would become the captain of the ship, she sent him to learn the tricks of the pirate business.  The young man announced that after leaving the ship, he would have to change his occupation. Now he has to fight with them. Besides, they are not successful pirates. A true villain does not have a sense of pity, but these pirates release all the children who are (or pretend to be) orphans. He asks his former friends to go away with him, but they did not agree, focusing on the fact that pirates business in comparison with the secular virtue is supposedly more honest.  Suddenly, the boy saw a group of girls & was affected by their beauty. As previously, except for the babysitter, he did not see other women. One of them offered to help him & the young people immediately fell in love. But the young man had no chance to warn them about the pirates’ closeness as they come & take the women in captivity. Suddenly appears major-general – the father of the captives. Learning of Pirates of Penzance, he pretends to be an orphan. This pacified the villains & they let girls go. In this simple way, major-general & his daughter became honorary members of the pirate gang.  Left alone with his thoughts in his estate, major-general is in remorse, because he so brazenly lied to the pirates. Even prayers & consolations of daughters do not produce the desired effect on him. Soon the police squad arrives, announcing the intention to arrest the pirate gang & this is admired by young girls.  Staying in gloomy reflections, Frederic decides to bring the police in pirate lair in order to atone the fact that he had been for so many years their accomplice. But the plans of the young man did not come true, because the head of the pirates announces him as his birthday fell on 29 February, i.e., is celebrated only once per every 4 years, in fact, he served only 5 years. So he should be serving 63 more years before his 80th birthday. The young man agrees with such reasoning & declares his readiness to return to the team, but before he reveals the lie of the old major-general. Perturbed pirates promise to avenge to an old man.  Beloved of the young man begs him to stay, but he is tied with mobsters with duty, therefore, cannot cease faithful service to them. The young man is torn between his duty & the desire to stay with the beloved girl, but she comforted him, promising to wait. When the police arrives, a brave girl asks to arrest the pirates who attacked the meantime her father's estate.  Pirates saw an old man, meditating on the beach & wanted to grab him, to punish him for his daring lie. But the police, who lurked nearby, enters the fray. Suddenly, the commander of the police squad, seeing that the forces are unequal, ordered the pirates in the name of queen to lay down their arms & surrender. Honest pirates, hearing the name of a respected & beloved queen, execute an order. Appears a babysitter of a boy & declares that the pirates are noblepersons who went the wrong way. Major-general, impressed by the latest news, allows them to take his daughters in marriage."
1776," NOTE: The show can be performed in one or two acts. Act I  Scene One On May 8, 1776, in Philadelphia, the Second Continental Congress proceeds with its business. John Adams, the widely disliked delegate from Massachusetts, is frustrated because Congress will not vote on, or even entertain debating, any of his proposals on independence. The other delegates, too preoccupied by the rising heat, implore him to sit down. (""Sit Down, John"")Adams' response is that Congress has done nothing for the last year but dawdle (""Piddle, Twiddle, and Resolve""). He reads the latest missive to his loving wife Abigail, who appears in his imagination. He asks if she and the other women are making saltpeter for the war effort, but she ignores him and states the women have a more urgent problem: no straight pins. They bicker about it until Adams gives in and they pledge their love to each other (""Till Then""). Scene Two Later that day, Adams finds delegate Benjamin Franklin outside.  Adams bemoans the failure of his arguments for independence; Franklin suggests that a resolution for independence would have more success if proposed by someone else. Richard Henry Lee of Virginia enters, having been summoned by Franklin. The cocky Lee crows that he is the best man to propose the resolution. Adams has reservations, but Lee is convinced he cannot fail, as a member of the oldest and most glorious family in America: the Lees (""The Lees of Old Virginia""). He is prepared to ask the Virginia House of Burgesses to authorize him to offer a pro-independence resolution. Scene Three June 7, 1776. Franklin and Adams enter, and the delegates, along with the President of Congress, John Hancock, and the Secretary, Charles Thomson, take their places. Hancock gavels the 380th meeting of the Congress to order.The entire New Jersey delegation is absent. Thomas Jefferson, a young delegate from Virginia, announces that he is leaving that night to visit his wife. Soon after Hancock opens the floor to new resolutions, Richard Henry Lee canters into the chamber, having finally returned from Virginia. Lee reads his resolution, but John Dickinson of Pennsylvania moves to indefinitely postpone the question of independence. A vote is taken; five colonies vote to debate the resolution and five vote for indefinite postponement; New York abstains ""courteously"" (which becomes a running gag throughout the play) and Stephen Hopkins of Rhode Island, after a momentary absence, votes for debate.As the debate proceeds, Caesar Rodney of Delaware is forced to return home due to poor health; Edward Rutledge of South Carolina moves to end the debate and proceed with the vote. The New Jersey delegation arrives with orders to support independence, resulting in a 6-6 split; New York again abstains ""courteously"", and Adams reminds Hancock, who supports independence, of his privilege as president to break ties. Dickinson then moves that any vote for independence must pass unanimously, on the grounds that ""no colony [may] be torn from its mother country without its own consent."" The vote produces the same tie, which Hancock breaks by unexpectedly voting for unanimity, prompting an angry outburst from Adams. Hancock reasons that without unanimity, any colony voting against independence would be forced to fight on England's side, setting brother against brother.Adams, thinking fast, calls for a postponement of the vote on independence, expressing the need for a declaration defining the reasons for independence. Franklin seconds Adams, but when asked why such a declaration should be written, both are lost for words until Thomas Jefferson provides them himself. The vote on postponement is called, producing yet another tie, with New York abstaining ""courteously"" yet again. Hancock breaks the tie by voting in favor of postponement. He appoints a committee of Adams, Franklin, Roger Sherman of Connecticut, Robert Livingston of New York, and Jefferson to draft the declaration. Hancock adjourns the session over Jefferson's complaints that he must go home to his wife.The five argue about who should write the declaration (""But, Mr. Adams""); one by one, each member gives a reason for being unable to do it, until all eyes turn to Jefferson. Jefferson tries to wriggle out, pleading that he has not seen his wife in six months. Adams, unmoved by Jefferson's arguments (as he, too, misses his own wife), quotes a passage of Jefferson's Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms, bluntly telling Jefferson that he is the best writer in Congress. Jefferson agrees to draft the document. Scene Four A week later, Adams and Franklin visit Jefferson to see how the work is coming along. Jefferson has spent the week moping, prompting a sharp rebuke by Adams, which is flatly rebuffed by Jefferson.  Finally, Jefferson is brightened when his beloved wife Martha enters, having been sent for by Adams; he and Franklin leave the young lovers in peace.  Adams, alone, again exchanges letters with his wife Abigail. They pledge each other to love each other eternally (""Yours, Yours, Yours""). Martha finally appears when Franklin and Adams return the next morning, and the two gentlemen ask her how a man as silent as Jefferson won a woman as lovely as she. She tells them that she loves him because of his musical talent (""He Plays the Violin""). Scene Five On June 22, Congress has reconvened.  By now, Adams is worrying and begins trying to win over some of the states, sending Thomas McKean to try to convince his Delaware colleague George Read and Franklin to convince James Wilson of Pennsylvania, while himself trying to convince Samuel Chase of Maryland.After receiving a request for help from George Washington in the field, Adams requests Chase accompany him to inspect a continental army training ground in New Jersey, and Chase agrees; after the pair leave with Franklin, the remaining delegates in favor of independence also leave the chamber. Alone with his fellow conservatives for the first time, Dickinson leads them in a minuet, singing of their desire to hold onto their wealth (""Cool, Cool Considerate Men""). During their dance, another dispatch comes from George Washington, warning them of British advances on Philadelphia; however, these warnings fall on deaf ears.After the dance, the remaining delegates depart, leaving Andrew McNair (the custodian), the courier, and a workman in the chamber. The workman asks the courier if he has seen any fighting, and the courier replies that his two closest friends were killed on the same day at Lexington. He describes the final thoughts of a dying young man as his mother searches for his body (""Momma Look Sharp""). Act II  Scene Six Jefferson is outside the chamber as Mr. Thomson, the secretary, reads the declaration to Congress. Adams and Franklin meet him delightedly: an exhibition of shooting by the Continental Army has convinced Samuel Chase, and Maryland will vote in favor of independence. They congratulate Jefferson on his work, and Franklin compares the creation of this new country to the hatching of a bird (""The Egg""). This leads the trio to debate which bird would best represent America; Franklin argues for the turkey, and Jefferson suggests the dove, but Adams insists on the eagle, and the others resign themselves to that choice. Scene Seven On June 28, Hancock asks if there are any alterations to be offered to the Declaration of Independence, leading many delegates to voice suggestions. Jefferson acquiesces to each recommendation, much to Adams's consternation, until Dickinson demands the removal of a phrase calling King George a tyrant. Jefferson refuses, stating that ""the King is a tyrant whether we say so or not. We might as well say so.""  When one delegate wants references to Parliament removed for fear of offending possible friends in that body, an exasperated Adams exclaims ""This is a revolution, damn it! We're going to have to offend somebody!""Edward Rutledge of South Carolina objects to a clause condemning the slave trade, accusing the northern colonies of hypocrisy because they also prosper from slavery, through the Triangle Trade (""Molasses to Rum""); he then leads a walk-out with the delegates from both Carolinas and Georgia. The resolve of the other delegates is broken, and most of them also leave. Franklin tells Adams that the slavery clause has to go; when Adams argues that it must remain, Franklin angrily reminds him that independence is the primary issue, and berates him for jeopardizing the cause. Adams' faith in himself is shaken, and only encouragement from Abigail, and the delivery of kegs of saltpeter from her and other Massachusetts ladies, bolsters his commitment.Re-reading a dispatch from Washington, Adams, now alone in the chamber, echoes his words (""Is Anybody There?""). Discouraged but determined, Adams declares his vision of his new country. Dr. Lyman Hall of Georgia unexpectedly returns to the chamber, telling Adams he is changing Georgia's vote from ""nay"" to ""yea"".It is now July 2. The delegates slowly return to the chamber, including the last-minute arrival of Caesar Rodney from Delaware. Hancock calls for the vote on the Lee Resolution; Thomson calls on each delegation for its vote. Pennsylvania passes on the first call, but the rest of the northern and middle colonies (save New York, which, with some self-disgust, again abstains ""courteously"") vote ""yea"".  When the vote reaches South Carolina, Rutledge again demands the removal of the slavery clause as the condition of the ""yea"" votes from the Carolinas. Franklin pleads with Adams to remove the clause, and Adams turns to Jefferson; Jefferson reluctantly crosses the chamber and scratches out the clause himself. Rutledge and the Carolinas vote ""yea"", as does Georgia.Pennsylvania's vote, which is the last vote needed to obtain the required unanimous approval, is called again; Dickinson declares that ""Pennsylvania votes..."", only to be stopped by Franklin, who asks Hancock to poll the members of the delegation individually. Franklin votes ""yea"" and Dickinson ""nay"", leaving the swing vote to Wilson, who normally adheres to Dickinson. Dickinson and Adams both vie for his vote, until Wilson says he doesn't want to be remembered as ""the man who prevented American independence"" and votes ""yea"". The motion is passed.Hancock suggests that no man be allowed to sit in Congress without signing the Declaration. Dickinson announces that he cannot in good conscience sign it, and still hopes for reconciliation with England; however, he resolves to join the army to fight for and defend the new nation. Adams leads Congress in a salute to Dickinson as he leaves the chamber.Hancock leads the delegates in signing the Declaration, but is interrupted by the courier with another dispatch from Washington, ""Commander of the Army of the United Colonies ... of the United States of America."" He reports that preparations for the Battle of New York are under way, but expresses concern about America's badly outnumbered and under-trained troops. Washington's note to Lewis Morris that his estates have been destroyed, but that his family has been taken to safety, emboldens Morris to state that he will sign the Declaration, despite the lack of instructions from the New York legislature, saying, ""To hell with New York. I'll sign it anyway."" New York's vote is moved into the ""yea"" column.On the evening of July 4, McNair rings the Liberty Bell in the background as Thomson calls each delegate to sign the Declaration. The delegates freeze in position as the Liberty Bell rings to a fevered pitch.","The Second Continental Congress started working on May 8, 1776 in Philadelphia. Massachusetts Representative John Adams was distressed because of the fact that his proposal for the independence of the American colonies were not allowed to discuss. The rest of the delegates, on the contrary, were delighted with these news, hoped that he finally stops to put forward such a demand. Adams realized – Congress does nothing but conversations. After reading the letter of his wife, the delegate did not find the answer to question he asked her. Spouse was more concerned that she had not seen her husband for a long time. The next day, Adams came to Benjamin Franklin. He was upset that the latter did not support his proposal for independence. The delegate also said – a question like this for discussion was best to be promoted by the other person. Virginia Representative agreed to raise this topic in Congress.  When Richard Henry Lee put a resolution on the independence on vote, John Dickinson of Pennsylvania asked to postpone this discussion on indefinite time. Congressmen of five colonies would consider a resolution now, but the opinion of the representatives of the other six states outweighed. Suddenly in the hall appeared the late delegate from New Jersey. He called for discussion of the independence of the colonies, and the balance of opinion on this subject has come. Adams urged the President of the Congress to deal this stalemate with his voice. Dickinson also put a statement for discussion saying that all the colonies should unanimously support the resolution on independence. As a result, the advantage was gained by supporters. John Adams has asked to postpone the discussion, saying the fact that it was necessary to create a declaration, which would clearly describe the laws of Independence. After voting, the delegates formed a committee to develop the project. It included Adams, Franklin, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston, and Thomas Jefferson.  Soon members of the committee began to discuss which of them would write a future Declaration. Several people took the rejection. As a result, Jefferson was instructed to do that – he was the best writer among present. A week later, Adams and Franklin checked the progress in the work of the delegate. Being in spleen, Jefferson almost did not do anything – he missed his wife, to whom he wanted to go earlier. He was cheered by the unexpected arrival of his wife. John Adams sent for a woman, realizing that it was necessary to support the delegate. On June 22, 1776, hearings in Congress resumed. Supporters of independence have tried to influence the representatives of other states. After reading the declaration a few people went to their side. Soon was adopted a symbol of the future country – the eagle won over the turkey and pigeon, which were also offered by other delegates. During the discussion of the Declaration, many recommendations of congressmen were included in it. The delegate from South Carolina demanded to remove condemnation of slavery from the text. John Adams was against it, but Franklin said that independence was more important than the fate of the black population of the country. With coaxing, they could get the votes of delegates of all states – even the representative of New York, who usually remained neutral. In the evening, July 4, 1776 the establishment of the new American country was recorder officially."
"Kiss Me, Kate"," Act IThe cast of a musical version of William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew is rehearsing for the opening of the show that evening (""Another Op'nin', Another Show""). Egotistical Fred Graham is the director and producer and is starring as Petruchio, and his movie-star ex-wife, Lilli Vanessi, is playing Katherine. The two seem to be constantly arguing, and Lilli is particularly angry that Fred is pursuing the sexy young actress Lois Lane, who is playing Bianca. After the rehearsal, Lois's boyfriend Bill appears; he is playing Lucentio, but he missed the rehearsal because he was gambling. He tells her that he signed a $10,000 IOU in Fred's name, and Lois reprimands him (""Why Can't You Behave?"").Before the opening, Fred and Lilli meet backstage, and Lilli shows off her engagement ring from Washington insider Harrison Howell, reminding Fred that it's the anniversary of their divorce. They recall the operetta in which they met, which included ""Wunderbar"", a Viennese waltz; they end up fondly reminiscing and singing and dancing. Two gangsters show up to collect the $10,000 IOU, and Fred replies that he never signed it. The gangsters obligingly say they will give him time to remember it and will return later. In her dressing room, Lilli receives flowers from Fred, and she declares that she is still ""So In Love"" with him. Fred tries to keep Lilli from reading the card that came with the flowers, which reveals that he really intended them for Lois. However, Lilli takes the card with her onstage, saying she will read it later.The show begins (""We Open in Venice""). Baptista, Katherine and Bianca's father, will not allow his younger daughter Bianca to marry until his older daughter Katherine is married. However, she is shrewish and ill-tempered, and no man desires to marry her. Three suitors – Lucentio, Hortensio, and Gremio – try to woo Bianca, and she says that she would marry any of them (""Tom, Dick, or Harry""). Petruchio, a friend of Lucentio, expresses a desire to marry into wealth (""I've Come to Wive it Wealthily in Padua""). The suitors hatch a plan for him to marry Kate, as Baptista is rich. Kate, however, has no intentions of getting married (""I Hate Men""). Petruchio attempts to woo her (""Were Thine That Special Face""). Offstage, Lilli has an opportunity to read the card. She walks on stage off-cue and begins hitting Fred, who, along with the other actors, tries to remain in character as Baptista gives Petruchio permission to marry Kate. Lilli continues to strike Fred, and he ends up spanking her. Offstage, Lilli furiously declares she is leaving the show. However, the gangsters have reappeared, and Fred tells them that if Lilli quits, he'll have to close the show and won't be able to pay them the $10,000. The gangsters force her to stay at gunpoint. Back onstage, Bianca and Lucentio dance while the chorus performs ""We Sing of Love"", covering a scene change. The curtain opens, revealing the exterior of a church; Petruchio and Kate have just been married, and they exit the church; the gangsters, dressed in Shakespearean costume, are onstage to make sure that Lilli stays. Petruchio implores for Kate to kiss him, and she refuses. He lifts her over his shoulder and carries her offstage while she pummels his shoulder with her fists (""Kiss Me Kate"").Act IIDuring the show's intermission, the cast and crew relax in the alley behind the theater. Paul (Fred's assistant), along with a couple other crew members, lament that it's ""Too Darn Hot"" to meet their lovers that night. The play continues, and Petruchio tries to 'tame' Katherine and mourns for his now-lost bachelor life (""Where Is the Life That Late I Led?""). Off-stage, Lilli's fiancé Harrison Howell is looking for Lilli. He runs into Lois, and she recognizes him as a former lover but promises not to tell Lilli. Bill is shocked to overhear this, but Lois tells him that even if she is involved with other men, she is faithful to him in her own way (""Always True to You in My Fashion""). Lilli tries to explain to Howell that she is being forced to stay at the theatre by the gangsters, but Howell doesn't believe her and wants to discuss wedding plans. Fred insidiously points out how boring Lilli's life with Howell will be compared to the theatre. Bill sings a love song he has written for Lois (""Bianca"").The gangsters discover that their boss has been killed, so the IOU is no longer valid. Lilli leaves—without Howell—as Fred unsuccessfully tries to convince her to stay (""So in Love"" (Reprise)). The gangsters get caught on stage and improvise a tribute to Shakespeare in which they explain that knowing Shakespeare is the key to romance (""Brush Up Your Shakespeare""). The company prepares for the conclusion of the play, the wedding of Bianca and Lucentio, even though they are now missing one of the main characters. However, just in time for Katherine's final speech, Lilli arrives onstage (""I Am Ashamed That Women Are So Simple""). Fred and Lilli wordlessly reconcile on stage, and the play ends (""Kiss Me Kate"" (Finale)) with them, as well as Bill and Lois, kissing passionately.","The main characters are actors who rehearse Shakespeare's play. There are the following people in collective: a director Fred, playing a major role and his ex-wife, the main actress. Couple constantly quarrels. Lilly is jealous him of young Lois, who plays Bianca. Her friend Bill misses rehearsal, but appears after it. The girl is in love with him. He says that he has written down a large sum of money on the name of director.  Lilly reminds Fred that one year from the moment of their divorce has passed. They remember their past with dancing and romantic music. Later the woman receives flowers from the ex-husband and admits that she still loves him. The card, which is addressed to Lois, is attached to flowers, but Lilly promises to read it later. Meanwhile, gangsters press Fred to return them money, but the man doesn't even know about it. Mobsters promise to return for his soul.  During a performance, Lilly reads a card. She is very angry. Suddenly the woman steps on the stage and hits Fred. Fred doesn't keep it up and slightly hits her. After a performance, Lilly declares that she leaves. But in this case the man should close a performance and he won't be able to give money to gangsters. They promise to take care of that Lille remained. On a scene, Fred asks the heroine to kiss him. The woman refuses. Then Fred takes her and bears behind the scenes. The performance continues. Fred's character tries to tame Lille. Meanwhile, her groom comes there. Lois understands that he is her former beloved. She promises not to tell Lille about it. Bill incidentally hears over their conversation. The girl says that everything is in the past and she loves only him.  The head of mobsters was killed. Now they don't need to ask Fred to return money. Lilly's groom wants to prepare for a wedding. He doesn't believe that the woman is detained in theater by gangsters. Fred says that life of Lilly will be boring without theater. But his attempts are unsuccessful. Lilly leaves alone. Actors play a performance without her. At the last minute, she appears on a scene. Love couples (Fred and Lilly, Bill and Lois) kiss."
Damn Yankees," NOTE: This is the plot of the 1994 Broadway revival of the show; there are differences from the original 1955 version. For the 1958 film version, see Damn Yankees (film).Middle-aged real estate agent Joe Boyd is a long-suffering fan of the pathetic Washington Senators baseball team. His wife, Meg, laments this (""Six Months Out Of Every Year""). After she has gone to bed, he sits up late, grumbling that if the Senators just had a ""long ball hitter"" they could beat ""those damn Yankees"". Suddenly, the smooth-talking Mr. Applegate appears. He offers Joe the chance to become ""Joe Hardy"", the young slugger the Senators need. He accepts, even though he must leave Meg (""Goodbye Old Girl""). However, his business sense makes him insist on an escape clause. The Senators' last game is on September 25, and if he plays in it, he is to stay as Joe Hardy forever. If not, he has until 9:00 the night before to walk away from the deal and return to his normal life.At the ballpark, the hapless Senators vow to play their best despite their failings (""Heart""). Then Joe Hardy is suddenly discovered and joins the team. Gloria, a reporter, praises him (""Shoeless Joe from Hannibal, Mo""). His hitting prowess enables the team to move up in the standings.Though Joe is increasingly successful, he truly misses Meg and moves into her house as a boarder in his persona as Joe Hardy. They begin to bond, especially over her ""lost"" husband (""A Man Doesn't Know""). Fearful of losing his deal, Applegate calls Lola, ""the best homewrecker on [his] staff"", to seduce Joe and ensure his loss of the bet. She promises to deliver (""A Little Brains, A Little Talent""), and Applegate introduces her as a sultry South American dancer named ""Señorita Lolita Banana."" She sings a seductive song (""Whatever Lola Wants""), but Joe's devotion to Meg proves too strong, even for her. Applegate punishes her by firing her, where she performs with other past workers for Applegate (""Who's Got the Pain"").Applegate decides to switch tactics to ensure Joe's failure. He releases false information about Joe's true identity being ""Shifty McCoy"", an escaped criminal and con artist. When Gloria discovers this information, she presses charges, and he is forced into court.The Senators prepare for the final game against the Yankees for the pennant and worry about Joe, but they vow to think of nothing but winning (""The Game""). Meanwhile, angry fans are seeking him out, so he decides to leave home. As he does so, he tells Meg indirectly that he is her old husband (""Near to You""). Meanwhile, Applegate is exhausted by the work he has put into winning one bet and thinks about the ""simpler"" times in his long history (""Those Were the Good Old Days"").Joe's day in court is on September 24, the last day of his deal. As he technically does not exist, he can't produce any kind of identification. The owner of the Senators, their coach, and even Lola (disguised as ""Señora McCoy"") testify; unfortunately, their opinions are invalid. Gloria suggests that Applegate take the stand, but he is unable to take the oath due to its provision against lying. ""Don't you have another version of that thing?"" he asks. Joe realizes that Applegate is simply stalling to keep him from meeting his 9:00 deadline. Applegate claims that Joe ""just needs time to think"" and sends him to where Lola is, where history's most famous lovers wait. Lola meets him there and realizes that he truly loves Meg. She helps him by sending him into the final game and delays Applegate by coercing him into a duet (""Two Lost Souls"").When Applegate finally arrives at the game, it is 8:55, and Joe is at bat. As time runs out, Meg, her friends, and even Lola begin cheering for him. Applegate uses his powers to give Joe two strikes. The clock strikes nine, and Applegate claims victory, but at the last second, Joe cries, ""Let me go!"" The deal is broken, and he is transformed back into his old self. Amazingly, he is still able to hit a home run and win the Senators the pennant.Back at home, Joe rushes into Meg's arms. Applegate appears on the scene, claiming that Joe owes him his prize. He begs Meg to hold him and not let go, and she begins to sing (""Finale (A Man Doesn't Know)""). Applegate promises to make him young again and even ensure a World Series victory. But his powers are useless against their true love, which Lola points out. He shouts that such a thing can't exist, but he is wrong. He and Lola vanish back to where they came from, defeated, with Joe and Meg united.","From time to time on the stage and in the movies there are such films where someone sells his soul to the Devil in exchange for some very strong desire (please mind that always HE sells, never SHE). Here we have an old fan of the baseball team, who longs them to win from Yankees in the World Cup (though ""world"" is, though the official status of these games, untrue, as everyone knows that only the Americans are baseball-addicted and no other nation understands the rules of & have no interest to this game).  So much he wants their victory, that says this aloud that he’ll sell his soul, so they just received some young and talented balls slugger. And here comes the Devil, who offers him exactly this – he takes his soul in exchange for making him a young and very successful slugger who will lead this team to success. But this fan, having a flair, understanding the necessity to leave himself a loophole, also agrees that if he will reach the final game with the team, the soul will forever be considered sold, and if he leaves before the end of it, the deal is off & he gets his life back. The transaction starts, but he has to leave his wife, whom he loves very much.  He was quickly taken to the team and all wildly liked a new player who deals with all the balls. But he is very sad for his wife and is even thinking to go back to her. Devil, trying to prevent this, sent him charming beauty, so that she did her job. As she failed, the Devil sent her down, to sing along with fallen souls.  The Devil sues a player to the court, under false accusations. Besides the fact that the whole thing is delayed, because Devil in human form as the prosecutor is unable to swear on the Bible that he would not lie on his testimony, and the identity of the fan/player does not exist at all, an opposing force transfers him from the court on the game – the very final one. Although he in a second before its completion shouted to the Devil to let him go, breaking the contract for the sale of the soul, he still ends the game, leading his team to a victory. The Devil himself complains that now it takes very big efforts to get only one human soul, not as previously (Those Were the Good Old Days).  Although he returned to his wife, the Devil comes to him, demanding a soul. He asks his wife to hold him tight, which she does. And it turns out that the strength of the Devil is powerless against True Love. He goes to Hell along with his henchmen, and the player happily embraces his wife, and they stay together."
American Idiot," Set in the recent past, the musical opens with a group of suburban youths living unhappily in ""Jingletown, USA"". Fed up with the state of the union, the company explodes in frustration during the song ""American Idiot"". One of the youths, Johnny, begins to tell his story in the five-song medley ""Jesus of Suburbia"", he talks about coming from a broken home and seeming to be lost in the world. He soon goes to commiserate with his friend Will, and a third friend, Tunny, joins the two at Will's house. As they party and get drunk they soon run out of beer, prompting them to pick up more at the local 7-Eleven. Tunny soon exposes the do-nothing go-nowhere quicksand of their lives in the ""City of the Damned"". Realising they aren't going anywhere, Johnny challenges his friends to start caring about their lives and everything around them (""I Don't Care""). Soon Will's girlfriend, Heather, comes into the story. She finds out that she will have a baby soon, and after seeing Will getting drunk and high with his friends she feels that she can't get through to him in ""Dearly Beloved"". Johnny borrows money and buys bus tickets to the city for the three young men, eager to escape suburbia. Before the boys are able to leave, Heather tells Will of her pregnancy. With no other choice, he tells his friends he must stay at home in ""Tales of Another Broken Home"". Johnny and Tunny soon depart for the city with a group of other jaded youths (""Holiday"").While Johnny wanders the city alone, he pines for a woman he sees in an apartment window. Johnny's dreams and expectations of the city have fallen short so far as he sings ""Boulevard of Broken Dreams"". While Tunny finds it hard to adjust to urban life, he spends his time watching television and is seduced by America's favourite son, the all-American sex symbol who everyone wants to be. He is slowly convinced that the favourite son is everything he wants to be as well. (""Favorite Son""). With stars in his eyes from Favorite Son Tunny realises that his generation has been so numbed and apathetic that nothing, not even the bright lights of the city, will excite him. In the song ""Are We the Waiting"", Tunny enlists in the army and is shipped off.Back in the city, a frustrated Johnny manifests a rebellious drug-dealing alter ego called St. Jimmy. Johnny takes party drugs for the first time during the song ""St. Jimmy"". His new-found courage thanks to St. Jimmy and the drugs allow Johnny to make a successful move on the girl in the window. Back in Jingletown, Will sits on the couch as his girlfriend's pregnancy progresses. He drinks beer and begs for a release. Meanwhile, Tunny is deployed to a war zone, and is soon shot and wounded. Will and Tunny sing ""Give Me Novacaine"" as they are both in need of a pain reliever in their current predicaments.Two weeks later, Johnny admits he has injected heroin for the first time and spends the night with the girl he saw in the window, whom he calls ""Whatsername"". Johnny is smitten with Whatsername and wants to celebrate, but St. Jimmy has other plans for them in ""Last of the American Girls/She's a Rebel"" where Johnny and Whatsername go to a club together. St. Jimmy hands Johnny heroin and he pressures Whatsername into injecting with him. St. Jimmy sets the mood, Whatsername expresses her trust in Johnny, and Heather pledges her love to her newborn baby in ""Last Night on Earth"".Will is increasingly neglectful as Heather tenderly commits herself to her baby's future. Heather has had enough of Will's pot-and-alcohol-fuelled apathy. Despite Will's protestations, she takes the baby and walks out (""Too Much, Too Soon""). At around the same time, lying in a bed in an army hospital (""Before the Lobotomy""), Tunny falls victim to the hopelessness he has seen during wartime and hallucinates. He and his nurse engage in a balletic aerial dance (""Extraordinary Girl""). He quickly falls in love with her. His hallucination disappears, and he's left with his fellow soldiers in agony (""Before the Lobotomy (Reprise)"").Back in the city, Johnny reveals the depth of his love for Whatsername as she sleeps (""When It's Time""). The temptation of drugs, however, is too great; St. Jimmy forces Johnny to become increasingly erratic, and he eventually threatens Whatsername (and then himself) with a knife (""Know Your Enemy""). Whatsername attempts to talk about Johnny's behaviour, while the Extraordinary Girl dresses Tunny's wounds and Heather and her baby are far away from Will who sits on the couch, once again alone (""21 Guns""). Johnny leaves a note for Whatsername, saying he has chosen St. Jimmy and drugs over her. Angry and done, Whatsername tells Johnny that he is not the ""Jesus of Suburbia"" and reveals that St. Jimmy is nothing more than ""a figment of [his] father's rage and [his] mother's love"" (""Letterbomb""). She leaves him and his unwillingness to acknowledge his issues behind.Hurt by Whatsername's departure, Johnny longs for better days ahead, Tunny longs for home, and Will longs for all the things he's lost (""Wake Me Up When September Ends""). St. Jimmy appears and makes one last attempt to get Johnny's attention, but Johnny has made the conscious decision to end his self destruction, resulting in the metaphorical suicide of St. Jimmy (""The Death of St. Jimmy""). Johnny cleans up and gets a desk job but soon realises there is no place for him there or in the city (""East 12th Street""). Will, all alone with his television, bemoans his outcast state (""Nobody Likes You""). Will imagines Heather appearing with her new show-off rockstar boyfriend who is much cooler than Will (""Rock and Roll Girlfriend""). Sick of staying on his couch, Will heads to the 7-Eleven and, surprisingly, finds Johnny there. Johnny had sold his guitar for a bus ticket home. Tunny returns from the war zone (as an amputee) with the Extraordinary Girl. As Tunny introduces his friends to the Extraordinary Girl, Johnny becomes furious with him for leaving the group, but quickly forgives him and the three friends embrace. Heather and her rockstar boyfriend arrive in style. In an uneasy truce, she gives the baby to Will. Other friends show up to greet the three men they haven't seen in a year (""We're Coming Home Again""). One year later, Johnny laments that he lost the love of his life, but he accepts that he can live inside the struggle between rage and love that has defined his life. With this acceptance comes the possibility of hope (""Whatsername"").After the cast takes their bows, the curtain rises to reveal the entire company with guitars, and they perform ""Good Riddance (Time of Your Life)"". Each performance of this song was recorded and given to the audience as a free digital download.","The story of a certain group of teenagers, spending their time in vain, living with boring days – where everything is endlessly repeated – TV, despair, idleness, lack of desire and no-wannabe to develop and go somewhere to do something. One of them, Will, has a girl and she turns out pregnant. Although his friends, Johnny and Tunny (with nearly indistinguishable names like the symbolism of the fact that all the faceless in today's world) leave to a small town, to try & find themself (forgetting or not knowing that when you're trying to escape from yourself, you still take you with you).  With the songs Boulevard of Broken Dreams and Are We the Waiting, the hero of Tunny decides to go to the army, because he does not know where to apply himself in this world, what to focus his efforts on and seduced by continuous television advertising (which calls for the army, describing it the best place). Yes, the army can make a tough guy from gruel, to instill an iron will or it may completely brake you and make you return home. Army can even kill you, because there is a chance that you will go to war.  St. Jimmy is a character whom we find from the same man who plays Johnny – he is his alter-ego, a drug dealer and no saint at all. Under the influence of such a schizophrenic split of personality, which appears due to idleness, he uses strong illegal substance, which begins to influence his life in abnormal way. At this time, our concerns about the incompetence of the army in terms of maintaining the integrity of the physiological embodiment justified – our antihero, Tunny, goes to war, where he was wounded. And in the fictional town of Jingletown Will meanwhile toils of longing and expectation of the upcoming baby.  Next is a long story about the joint use of psychoactive drugs, physical love, separation, recovery of Tunny in hospital, returning home after amputation, with a very good girl. Johnny is released from his alter-ego and drug addiction, knowing that he must reconcile himself to live on."
Chess," summary  Act 1 The president of the International Chess Federation—The Arbiter—speculates on the origins of the game of chess (""Story of Chess"") before announcing the location of the upcoming world chess championship: Merano, Italy. As the townsfolk prepare for the occasion (""Merano""), the current world champion, Freddie Trumper of the United States, arrives with his second and presumed lover: Hungarian-born, English-raised Florence Vassy (""Freddie's Entrance""). Florence confronts Freddie about his brash behavior and rocky relationship with the press (""Commie Newspapers""), which immediately gets out of hand when he assaults a journalist who questions his relationship with Florence (""Press Conference""). Meanwhile, Freddie's Soviet Russian challenger, Anatoly Sergievsky, argues with his own second, the scheming Molokov (""Anatoly and Molokov""). Afterwards, in private, Anatoly cynically reflects on the selling out of his dreams to get to where he is today (""Where I Want to Be"").The opening ceremony features the American and Soviet delegates each vowing their side will win (""Diplomats""), The Arbiter insisting on a clean game (""The Arbiter""), and marketers looking to make a profit (""Hymn to Chess"" / ""Merchandisers""). During the increasingly intense match, Freddie suddenly throws the chessboard to the floor and storms out of the arena (""Chess #1""), leaving Florence to negotiate with Anatoly, Molokov, and The Arbiter (""Quartet""). Florence manages to arrange a meeting between the two players, after trading heated words with Molokov. It turns out that Freddie engineered the outburst in the hopes of extracting more money from his sponsor, an American sensationalist media company called Global Television, though Walter—the company's representative in Freddie's delegation—criticizes the stunt as ludicrous (""Florence and Molokov""). Florence later scolds Freddie, and they fight about the politics of the tournament until he viciously turns the argument toward her missing father, believed captured or killed by Soviet forces during the 1956 Hungarian Revolution (""1956: Budapest is Rising""). She laments the situation alone (""Nobody's Side"") before heading off to the Merano Mountain Inn for the reconciliatory meeting she has scheduled between Freddie and Anatoly (""Der Kleine Franz""). Freddie does not immediately turn up, though, leaving Anatoly and Florence awkwardly alone together; however, they eventually embrace as romantic feelings arise before being finally interrupted by Freddie, who was working out new financial terms with Global TV (""Mountain Duet"").The chess tournament proceeds. Distracted by the loss of Florence's love, however, Freddie flounders, leaving himself just one more loss away from losing his title (""Chess #2""). Due to Freddie's atrocious attitude, Florence finally deserts him (""Florence Quits""), whereby Freddie ponders how his unhappy childhood left him the man he is today (""Pity the Child""). He sends The Arbiter a letter of resignation, resulting in Anatoly's becoming the new world champion. Anatoly immediately defects from the Soviet Union and seeks asylum at the British embassy (""Defection"" / ""Embassy Lament""). Florence, accompanying Anatoly, reflects on their newfound romance (""Heaven Help My Heart""). Meanwhile, Walter tips off the press about this scandal. When the mob of reporters ambush Anatoly and ask why he is deserting his country (""Anatoly and the Press""), he tells them that he will never truly leave his country, and that his land's only borders lie around his heart (""Anthem""). Act 2 A year later, Anatoly is set to defend his championship in Bangkok, Thailand (""Golden Bangkok""). Freddie is already there, chatting up locals and experiencing the Bangkok nightlife (""One Night in Bangkok""); he is Global TV's official commentator for the tournament. Florence and Anatoly are now openly lovers, and worry about Freddie's sudden reappearance as well as the impending arrival of Anatoly's estranged wife, Svetlana, from Russia (""One More Opponent"" / ""You and I""), which Anatoly suspects is part of Molokov's plan to shame him into returning to the Soviet Union. Molokov, meanwhile, has trained a new protégé, Leonid Viigand, to challenge, defeat, and humiliate Anatoly (""The Soviet Machine"").Walter, now Freddie's boss, manipulates Freddie into embarrassing Anatoly on live TV during an eventually heated interview between them (""The Interview""). Molokov, who indeed is responsible for Svetlana's presence in Bangkok, blackmails her into urging Anatoly to throw the match. Walter, who has been promised the release of certain captured American agents if he can ruin Anatoly's performance, informs Florence that her father is still alive though imprisoned, and that he too will be released if she can convince Anatoly to lose. Despite Molokov and Walter's efforts, none of their ploys work to get Anatoly to throw the game. As a result, Molokov and Walter team up to get Freddie to personally persuade Anatoly and Florence, knowing that Freddie is vengeful toward Anatoly and interested in winning back the love of Florence; however, Freddie's attempts also fail (""The Deal"").Surprisingly, Svetlana and Florence end up bonding over their respective relationships with Anatoly. Florence ultimately admits that it would be best for Anatoly to return to his children and Svetlana (""I Know Him So Well""). Anatoly, meanwhile, follows an anonymous letter guiding him to Wat Pho, where Freddie appears to tell him that he is willing to put their conflict behind him. Having decided that he only wants Anatoly to ""be true to the game"", Freddie informs Anatoly of a significant flaw in Viigand's strategy that will help Anatoly win (""Talking Chess"").In the deciding game of the match, with the score tied at five games all, Svetlana castigates Anatoly for wallowing in the crowd's empty praise and Florence expresses similar annoyance with him for casting aside his ideals; regardless, Anatoly achieves a superb victory against Viigand (""Endgame""). Later, Florence confesses her feelings that he should return to his family in the Soviet Union. The pair reflects on the conclusion of their romance (""You and I: Reprise""). Walter later approaches Florence with the news that Anatoly has defected back to the USSR, meaning that her father will certainly be released. He startlingly admits, however, that no one actually knows if her father is still alive. Florence breaks down, realising that she too has been used, and she sadly mirrors Anatoly's earlier sentiment that her only borders lie around her heart (""Anthem: Reprise"").

The first has a companion, a woman of Hungarian origin, which was grown in England. The second brought a hidden KGB officer, who must ensure that Anatoly would not escape from USSR falling with temptations of life in the United States.  The first game was lost by Freddie – the current world chess champion – and he goes to discuss the financial terms of his play with his sponsors. During the discussion, his companion having affair with Anatoly and it is flamed at the beginning of the second round of the tournament, despite the fact that Anatoly has a wife and children in the USSR. Freddie sees this affair and it hardens him and plunges into despair. He loses the tournament to Anatoly, making Anatoly world chess champion. Anatoly immediately submits to diplomatic asylum in the United States, in order to avoid returning to the Soviet Union.  At the beginning of the second act, we see how a new big chess tournament is going, this time taking place in Bangkok – the capital of Thailand. Freddie already there, enjoys the delights of the nightlife of this eastern metropolis. Freddie has to voice the tournament, and he now has a former companion as his boss, whose mission is to prevent Anatoly confirm his world title. A former girl of Freddie, which is now lover of Anatoly, despite his married status, has similar task – to prevent him to win. And here comes his wife, who also wants to return Anatoly to Soviet Union. Alternately interfere him through various insidious plans, all three fail and Anatoly wins the tournament. But later he nevertheless decides to return to the USSR, as they all three wanted to."
The Drowsy Chaperone," The Man in Chair, a mousy, agoraphobic Broadway fanatic, seeking to cure his ""non-specific sadness"", listens to a recording of the fictional 1928 musical comedy, The Drowsy Chaperone. As he listens to this rare recording, the characters appear in his dingy apartment, and it is transformed into an impressive Broadway set with seashell footlights, sparkling furniture, painted backdrops, and glitzy costumes. Man in Chair provides a running commentary throughout the show from the stage, though he is on the audience side of the fourth wall, invisible to the players. This commentary sporadically reveals aspects of his personal life, such as his failed marriage and implied attraction to Drowsy's leading man. In the opening number, ""Fancy Dress"", the premise and characters of the show are introduced: it's the day of the wedding of oil tycoon Robert Martin and Broadway star Janet Van De Graaff, who plans to give up her career for married life. Those in attendance include aging hostess Mrs. Tottendale; her loyal employee known only as Underling; Robert's best man, George; Broadway producer Feldzieg, who is hoping to persuade Janet to forgo marriage and continue starring in Feldzieg's Follies; ditzy flapper Kitty, who hopes to take Janet's place in the Follies; two gangsters disguised as pastry chefs; self-proclaimed famed Latin lover Aldolpho; Janet's alcoholic Chaperone, who is supposed to keep her away from Robert until the wedding; and Trix, an aviatrix.The gangsters reveal to Feldzieg that their boss has invested in the Follies and wants to make sure the show is a financial success, which it presumably will not be without Janet. They tell Feldzieg that he must sabotage the wedding and make sure Janet stays in show business. Feldzieg enlists the vain, easily manipulated Aldolpho to seduce Janet and spoil her relationship with Robert. Meanwhile, in his room, Robert realizes that he is nervous about the wedding. To get rid of his ""Cold Feets"", he tap dances, and George, who is also nervous, joins in the dance. George notes that tap dancing could be injurious, so he suggests that Robert go roller skating in the garden instead, while wearing a blindfold to keep him from seeing Janet. Outside by the pool, Janet tells reporters that she is happy to be getting married and ostensibly doesn't want to be an actress anymore (""Show Off""), but her song evolves into a big production number.In Janet's room, Janet is having doubts about whether Robert really loves her, and she asks the Chaperone for advice. The Chaperone responds with the extemporaneous ""As We Stumble Along"", a ""rousing anthem to alcoholism"", which, Man in Chair explains, the original actress playing the Chaperone insisted on including in the show. More helpfully, the chaperone tells Janet that she is feeling ""drowsy"" and must take a nap, giving Janet the opportunity to ask Robert if he loves her. Janet leaves for the garden, and Aldolpho enters, mistaking the Chaperone for Janet. The Chaperone happily pretends to be Janet and allows Aldolpho to ""seduce"" her (""I Am Aldolpho""). Janet meets the blindfolded and roller-skating Robert in the garden, and she pretends to be a French woman, ""Mimi,"" ""from ze middle part [of France], where zey make ze toast."" She asks Robert how he met his bride, and he describes their lovestruck first meeting (""Accident Waiting to Happen""). Carried away by his emotions, Robert kisses ""Mimi"" because she seems just like Janet. Janet furiously storms off because Robert has ""kissed a strange French girl"".Kitty, hoping to take Janet's place in the Follies, tries to demonstrate her mind-reading talents to Feldzieg, but he is unimpressed. The gangsters confront Feldzieg, threatening him with a murderous ""Toledo Surprise"" because he has not yet succeeded in cancelling the wedding. Feldzieg distracts them by insisting that they actually have singing and dancing talent, and they turn ""Toledo Surprise"" into an upbeat dance number. Aldolpho, with the Chaperone on his arm, announces that he has seduced the bride and the wedding is therefore cancelled, but Feldzieg angrily tells him he has seduced the wrong woman. Janet announces that she is cancelling the wedding, and Robert protests in vain that he only kissed ""Mimi"" because she reminded him of Janet (""Toledo Surprise"").Man in Chair announces that this is the end of the first act and the first record of the two-record set. He puts on another record, saying that the audience can listen to the opening of the second act of The Drowsy Chaperone, and leaves for the restroom. A scene set in an oriental palace appears onstage, with characters in stereotypical oriental costumes and the chaperone costumed as an Englishwoman in a hoopskirted dress (""Message from A Nightingale""). Man in Chair hurriedly stops the record, explaining to the audience that that was the wrong record—it was the musical The Enchanted Nightingale, not the second act of The Drowsy Chaperone. He finds the right record, and The Drowsy Chaperone continues.In a musical dream sequence, Janet laments her lost romance and decides to return to the stage (""Bride's Lament""). Mrs. Tottendale tells Underling that the wedding will proceed as planned because ""Love is Always Lovely"" in the end. She reveals to Underling that she is in love with him (""Love is Always Lovely in the End""). The Chaperone announces that there will be a wedding after all: she and Aldolpho are getting married (which Aldolpho helplessly protests). Mrs. Tottendale announces that she and Underling are getting married as well. Robert tells Janet that he loves her, and Man In Chair announces that one of his favorite parts is coming up. The Chaperone gives Janet advice on what to do as someone drops a cane and the Chaperone says ""l-ve while you can,"" leaving out the middle syllable of the word. Man In Chair has an emotional monologue where he expresses his wonderment about the phrase, asking if it says ""live while you can,"" or ""leave while you can."" He shares a brief backstory about his unsuccessful marriage and about how you should never leave, only live. The scene transforms back to Janet where she admits that she was really the French girl and agrees to marry him. To appease the gangsters, Feldzieg tells them that he has discovered a new star: Kitty. He asks her to demonstrate her mind-reading talent, and when she ""reads Feldzieg's mind"", she announces that he is asking her to marry him.George, now best man for all four weddings, realizes that he has failed at his most important task: finding a minister. Trix lands her plane in the garden, announcing she is about to depart for Rio. Because a captain on board a ship can perform marriages, everyone rationalizes that Trix, as a pilot, can perform marriages on board a plane, and she can fly them all to Rio for their honeymoons (""I Do, I Do in the Sky"").As the record is about to play the show's final chord, the power goes out in Man in Chair's apartment, and a superintendent arrives to check the circuit breakers. The power returns, the final chord plays, and the show is over.  Alone again, Man in Chair sadly expresses his deep love for a musical that he has never actually seen.  He begins to sing ""As We Stumble Along"" and the cast members, for the first time, acknowledge his presence, join in, and cheer him on (""As We Stumble Along (Reprise)"").","Events allegedly twisted in the mind of the man who sits in a chair in his rundown home and listens to the recording of non-existent musical The Drowsy Chaperone, created on Broadway in 1928. Suddenly, his apartment was transformed into a stage on which this musical goes. Events unfold around one oil tycoon who plans a wedding to the musical actress, who wants to finish her career and to become his wife. On the other hand, there are the gangsters, whose owner invested his money in a musical named Follies, where the future wife of tycoon plays a major part. Her silly and unpointed henchman Kitty wants to take the place of the lead actress after bride fiancé leaves the play. Mobsters require that a musical director by any means, thwart the engagement, because they don’t think that the financial success of the musical will happen if the main star leaves the stage. Kitty could not prove that she was talented enough to take the place of a leading actress and director is now trying to save the situation by hiring hottie handsome, so he seduced the bride.  The future groom worries about the upcoming event and, to relieve tension, his best man advises him to roll in the back garden with a blindfold, which is undoubtedly difficult but distracting. Seeing him doing this, his bride captures him and pretends to be some kind of a Frenchwoman, talking to him about that and about this, so he feels she is very similar to his bride & kisses her. She is furious that he kissed some French girl, announces the cancellation of the wedding, despite the sluggish attempts of the groom to protest. Her bridesmaid was confused with the bride by hired seducer and now, believing that he had seduced the bride, he informs all that the wedding is canceled for this reason. Then he was told of mistake.  Bride of magnate, Janet, eventually agrees with his arguments that he kissed the girl, just thinking about Janet. As a result, they are again planning a wedding. Director of Follies says to gangsters about a new star of the show, thick-headed Kitty. Latter declares to ""representatives of producer"" that she will be the wife of the director soon. In the backyard, of the house a plane suddenly lands and best man remembers that he did not find a priest for the wedding. In addition, all getting-married want to be espoused here and today. So they ask the pilot of the aircraft to marry them according to sea and air regulations, when the captain of the ship can be a betrothing priest. They board the plane to make it and to fly on it to their honeymoon."
A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder,"  Act I A group dressed in mourning enter and advise ""those of you of weaker constitution"" to leave the theater, as the show may prove disturbing (""Prologue: A Warning to the Audience""). In 1909, Lord Montague ""Monty"" D'Ysquith Navarro, Ninth Earl of Highhurst, is in jail. He says that he is writing his memoirs on the eve of his possible execution, and that his story could be called ""A Gentleman's Guide to Love and Murder."" He begins the storyIn 1907, Monty is living in a shabby Clapham flat and his mother, a washerwoman, has just died. Miss Marietta Shingle, a mysterious old woman, arrives to tell Monty that his mother was in fact a member of the aristocratic D'Ysquith family. Isobel D'Ysquith had eloped with a Spanish musician (now also deceased), which caused her family to disinherit and disown her. Wishing to spare her son any shame, Isobel never told him the truth of his ancestry. Now, Miss Shingle says, Monty is ninth in line to inherit the earldom of Highhurst. She insists that he take his rightful place in the family (""You're A D'Ysquith""). Monty writes a letter to Lord Asquith D'Ysquith, Sr., the head of the D'Ysquith family banking house, explaining his connection to the family and inquiring if there might be a job available for him.Monty is in love with Miss Sibella Hallward, but she will not marry him due to his poverty (""I Don't Know What I'd Do""). Sibella has also drawn the attention of another gentleman of higher status, Lionel Holland. She dubiously accepts Monty's story about his lineage, but remarks that eight people would have to die in order for him to become earl.Monty receives a reply from Lord Asquith's son, Asquith D'Ysquith, Jr., denying Isobel's existence and warning Monty against contacting the family again or using their name. Monty is dejected, but refuses to accept his apparent destiny as a poor commoner (""Foolish to Think""). He takes a tour of Highhurst Castle, the D'Ysquiths' ancestral home, on Visitor's Day, where the spirits of his D'Ysquith ancestors admonish him that he does not belong there (""A Warning to Monty""). Lord Adalbert D'Ysquith, the current Earl of Highhurst, catches Monty looking around the ancestral library and drives him out, expressing his disdain for the commoners flooding his home (""I Don't Understand the Poor"").Monty decides to try his luck with the clergyman in the family, a dithering old man named Reverend Lord Ezekial D'Ysquith. The Reverend gives Monty a tour of the ancestral family church. He remembers Isobel as a charming girl who broke her father's heart, but refuses to advocate on Monty's behalf, believing that it is best to avoid family intrigue. Monty and the Reverend ascend the bell tower, where the Reverend nearly loses his balance, thanks to a gusty wind and his own inebriation. Monty realizes how easy it would be to let the Reverend fall, exacting revenge for his mother and bringing him one step closer to the earldom (""Foolish to Think (Reprise)""). Rather than assisting the Reverend to safety, Monty lets Reverend Lord Ezekial fall to his death.Monty returns to his dead-end job as a clerk, frustrated that he toils away while unworthy men grow rich, including Asquith D'Ysquith, Jr. He observes Asquith, Jr. and his mistress Miss Evangeline Barley, a recent Florodora girl, steal away to a winter resort. Monty follows them with the intention of poisoning Asquith, Jr., but is unable to get close enough to deliver the poison. Asquith, Jr. and Miss Barley go ice-skating on a frozen lake, and Monty is struck by inspiration. He cuts a hole in the ice, and the skaters fall through and drown (""Poison in My Pocket"").Monty returns to London and receives a letter from Lord Asquith D'Ysquith, Sr., apologizing for the tone of his son's letter and inviting Monty to the bank to speak about a job. He is grief-stricken by his son's death in the skating ""accident,"" and offers Monty a comfortable salary and a job as a stockbroker. Monty accepts.Sibella informs Monty that she is engaged to marry Lionel Holland. Upon learning of Monty's new position and income, she begins to reconsider, but forces herself to go through with marrying Lionel (""Poor Monty"").Monty now fixes on his distant cousin Henry D'Ysquith, a country squire. He encounters Henry in a town pub and rescues him from an assault by a foreclosed-on tenant. Henry is married but clearly prefers the company of men; Monty picks up on this and befriends him (""Better With a Man""). Henry is also an avid beekeeper, and tells Monty that a person can be killed by an excess of bee-stings. Monty obtains a bottle of lavender perfume, to which the bees are extraordinarily attracted. At the D'Ysquith country estate in Salisbury, Monty douses Henry's beekeeping clothes with the lavender, and introduces himself to Henry's sister, Miss Phoebe D'Ysquith. As she and Monty discover their similarities, Henry is stung to death (""Inside Out""). Monty consoles Phoebe, and concludes that since he cannot be with Sibella, she would be the perfect woman to be his countess when he becomes earl. As a woman of his own generation, she does not stand before him in the line of succession, and is highly sympathetic to the plight of his mother. There are other women who do come before Monty in the lineage, including Lady Hyacinth D'Ysquith, an unmarried woman of a certain age, who devotes herself to philanthropic causes, primarily with the aim of bolstering her own social position. Posing as a member of the Foreign Office, Monty encourages Lady Hyacinth to travel first to war-torn Egypt, then to a leper colony in India, in order to dispose of her. She returns unharmed both times, before Monty sends her to an African jungle where a cannibal tribe lives. Lady Hyacinth is reported missing and presumed dead (""Lady Hyacinth Abroad"").Monty proves a talented stockbroker, securing a significant salary increase and praise from Lord Asquith D'Ysquith, Sr. (""The Last One You'd Expect - Part I""). His romance with Sibella continues despite her marriage and it is clear that she is impressed by Monty's determination to succeed (""The Last One You'd Expect - Part III"").Monty's next target is Major Lord Bartholomew D'Ysquith, a staunch eugenicist, vegetarian and bodybuilder. Monty encounters Lord Bartholomew at a weight-lifting hall and charms his way into acting as the Major's spotter on the bench-press apparatus. Pretending to misunderstand his cries for help, Monty adds more weight than Bartholomew can hold, and then allows the barbell to fall and decapitate him.Monty continues to console Phoebe; actions that during her period of mourning for her brother have endeared him to her greatly (“The Last One You'd Expect - Part V"").Lady Salome D'Ysquith Pumphrey is an appallingly bad actress currently starring in a production of Henrik Ibsen's Hedda Gabler. Remembering that the play ends with Hedda's suicide by a pistol shot to the head, Monty sneaks backstage and loads the prop gun with real bullets. Lady Salome shoots herself and dies, to the shock of her fellow actors and the approval of the audience.The deaths of Reverend Lord Ezekial, Asquith Jr., Henry, Lady Hyacinth, Major Lord Bartholomew, and Lady Salome now leave only two people in the way: the present earl and Lord Asquith, Sr., Monty's employer and benefactor. Monty is suddenly conflicted, finding he has no desire to murder the kindly Lord Asquith, but is let off the hook when the old man suddenly succumbs to a heart attack (""The Last One You'd Expect - Part VIII""). As Lord Adalbert realizes that he himself is the only D'Ysquith still alive, all of London is abuzz over the dashing young gentleman who's risen so far, so fast, and now stands next in line to inherit Highhurst (""The Last One You'd Expect - Part IX""). Act II The curtain rises on Lord Asquith, Sr.’s funeral. Monty delivers a stirring eulogy, but the assembled mourners are irritated at the endless string of D’Ysquith memorials they are compelled to attend (“Why Are All the D’Ysquiths Dying?”). Lord Adalbert worries that the curse that has fallen upon his family may strike him next (“Why Are All the D’Ysquiths Dying? (Reprise)”).Monty and Sibella continue their affair; he continues to love her despite his awareness of her flaws (“Sibella”). Sibella says that while she is unhappy with Lionel, she doesn't necessarily regret marrying for self-interest, and wouldn't begrudge Monty for doing the same. However, she would ""forbid"" him to marry for love. She also asks if Monty can secure Lionel an invitation to Highhurst, as he has political aspirations. Phoebe unexpectedly arrives, and Sibella hides in the next room. Phoebe declares her intention to marry Monty, even if the D’Ysquiths would look down on them. Monty accepts, but knows he is caught both figuratively and literally between the two women (“I’ve Decided to Marry You”).Monty is shocked to discover that Lady Hyacinth has survived her encounter with the cannibals and is returning to London. As she disembarks the ship, Monty uses an axe to cut the supports of the gangplank. It collapses, and she drowns in the harbor.Monty, Phoebe, Sibella, and Lionel are all invited to Highhurst for the weekend, so that Lord Adalbert can meet his heir. Monty and Phoebe arrive first, and meet the earl and his wife, Lady Eugenia D’Ysquith. The spirits of the D’Ysquith ancestors again warn Monty against presuming above his station (“Final Warning”). A long-brewing enmity between Lord Adalbert and Lady Eugenia is evident, and Adalbert makes several crass remarks about the scandal caused by Monty's mother. He and Monty head off to look at ""some of the weapons that killed our ancestors"" as Sibella arrives without Lionel, who's been detained in Newmarket. Phoebe and Monty's engagement is news to Sibella. She begs him to break it off and declares that she loves him. Although he still loves her, he angrily says that it is too late for her to claim ownership of him and that he will proceed with marrying Phoebe.At dinner, a truly awful meal is served and Lord Adalbert and Lady Eugenia bicker constantly. Monty has brought along poison, intending to slip it into Lord Adalbert's food, but cannot do so unnoticed (“Poison in My Pocket (Reprise)”). Miss Shingle, who initially brought Monty the news of his true lineage, appears; it turns out that she's been employed as a servant by the D’Ysquiths for 39 years.At last, Monty slips poison into Lord Adalbert's dessert, but to his horror, the earl refuses it, insisting Sibella eat it instead; Monty desperately knocks it to the floor. Lord Adalbert starts to tell the story of how he was betrayed by his valet during the Boer War (“Looking Down the Barrel of a Gun”). He gives Monty his loaded army rifle, and demands that he play the part of the valet, ordering Monty to aim the gun at him. Monty cannot bring himself to shoot the earl, and lowers the gun, his opportunity lost. Lord Adalbert takes a drink and, to Monty's surprise, suddenly drops dead.With Lord Adalbert's death, Monty is now Lord Montague D’Ysquith Navarro, Ninth Earl of Highhurst. He and Phoebe marry soon after. However, at the wedding reception, Chief Inspector Pinckney of Scotland Yard arrests him for the murder of Lord Adalbert, who, it has been discovered, was poisoned. Monty remarks on the absurdity of being charged with the one murder he didn't actually commit (“Stop! Wait! What?!”).A trial is held before the House of Lords, and evidence is given to both implicate and exculpate Monty. Sibella testifies on Monty's behalf, but, in a fit of passion, gives evidence that bolsters the prosecution's alleged motive for the crime: that the D’Ysquiths disinherited his mother and denied his existence.On the evening before the jury is to render judgment, Monty is writing his memoirs in his cell and strikes up a conversation with the jail's custodian, Chauncey. It turns out that Chauncey is a D’Ysquith too, his father having been a black sheep of the family, cast out in a manner similar to Isobel. Chauncey says he doesn't mind having not been acknowledged - he has none of the advantages of the D’Ysquiths, but none of their troubles, either. Moved by the encounter, Monty shakes the hand of his last remaining relation.Convinced of Monty's innocence, Phoebe visits him in jail. They conclude that an unseen providence is watching over him, but Phoebe has one important question to ask him: is Sibella in love with him? She takes his silence as an answer, and departs. Monty concludes his memoir, saying that the outcome will be revealed in the morning with the jury's verdict.Sibella arrives at the jail with a letter, purportedly from Phoebe and addressed to Monty, confessing to poisoning the earl so that Monty could take his rightful place. Phoebe returns to the jail with another letter, this one apparently from Sibella and also addressed to Monty, confessing the same thing. Both women plead for the other to be arrested and Monty set free. The authorities decided that both women appear equally culpable, and they can't convict one woman if they believe the other one guilty. Phoebe and Sibella have also provided reasonable doubt as to Monty's guilt. It becomes apparent to the audience that the two women have thus conspired to prevent Monty's conviction and execution (""That Horrible Woman"").Monty is awakened and, to his great surprise, set free. Cheering crowds greet him outside. Phoebe and Sibella are there, evidently content to share him between them. Monty suddenly realizes that he's left his memoirs, which contain a full confession, in his cell. However, a guard hands Monty the journal, saying he found it and thought Monty might need it. Reeling from this one last stroke of luck, Monty wonders who poisoned the earl, if he didn't. Miss Shingle appears, and confesses to the audience that it was she who slipped prussic acid into the earl's port. In the final moments of the show, the company sing “this is not the end,” and Chauncey appears, holding a small bottle of poison, singing ""Poison in My Pocket,"" implying that he will use it on Monty (“Finale”).After the curtain call, Monty hands Chauncey a poisonous belladonna flower. Chauncey eats it, grimaces, and exits the stage.","When Monty Navarro finds out he is eighth in line to inherit a dukedom, he decides to eliminate the other seven heirs standing in his way — all played by one incredible actor. This witty music-hall comedy explores how low we'll go to make it to the top."
The Fantasticks,"  Act I Two houses are separated by a wall (portrayed by a mute actor) in an unspecified American town.A mysterious bandit, El Gallo, tells about the kind of September ""when love was an ember about to billow"" (""Try to Remember""). He begins to narrate the plot of the play. Two young people, Matt and Luisa, live next door to each other and fall in love. However, their fathers are feuding and order them not to speak to each other. Luisa fantasizes about the experiences she wants to have in her life (""Much More""). Matt then delivers a speech about his love for Luisa, calling over the wall to her in a mock literary/heroic way (""Metaphor""). Matt and Luisa climb to the top of the wall and speak secretly of Luisa's romantic vision of Matt saving her from kidnapping. Matt's father, Mr. Hucklebee, then appears and tells about his philosophy of life and gardening (don't over-water). He orders Matt to go inside the house. Luisa's father, Mr. Bellomy, arrives and gives a contrasting philosophy of life and gardening (plenty of water). He orders Luisa inside. He then calls to Hucklebee, and the two old friends boast about their cleverness in pretending to feud as a means to ensure that their children fall in love. They note that to manipulate children you need merely to say ""no"" (""Never Say No""). Hucklebee tells Bellomy of his plan to end the feud by having Luisa ""kidnapped"" by a professional abductor so that Matt can ""rescue"" her and appear heroic.The hired professional, El Gallo, appears and offers the fathers a menu of different varieties of ""rape"" – in the literary sense of an abduction or kidnapping – that he can simulate (""It Depends on What You Pay""). Deciding to spare no expense for their beloved children (within reason), the fathers agree to a ""first class"" abduction scene.  A disheveled old actor with a failing memory, Henry Albertson, arrives with his sidekick, Mortimer, a Cockney dressed as an American Indian. El Gallo engages them to help with the staged kidnapping. Matt and Luisa return to speak of their love and hint at physical intimacy (""Soon It's Gonna Rain""). El Gallo and the actors burst in and carry out the moonlit abduction scenario; Matt ""defeats"" the three (""Rape Ballet""). The feud is ended and the wall between the houses torn down, with the children and the fathers joined in a picturesque final tableau (""Happy Ending""). El Gallo collects the stage properties used in the ""abduction"" and wonders aloud how long the lovers and their fathers will be able to maintain their elaborately joyful poses. He and The Mute leave. Act II The children and fathers are discovered in the same poses but are visibly exhausted by the effort. El Gallo observes that what seemed romantic by moonlight may lose its charm when exposed to the harsh light of day. He exchanges his moon for a blazing sun. The fathers and lovers begin to complain about one another, noticing all the flaws that have become glaringly visible by daylight (""This Plum Is Too Ripe"").  The children try to recreate their romantic mood from the previous night and mock their fathers. Eventually, in a fit of pique, Hucklebee reveals that the kidnapping and the feud were fake. Matt and Luisa are mortified, and the fathers' mutual recrimination quickly escalates into a real feud; they storm off to their respective houses. Matt sees El Gallo and, in a desperate attempt to regain his honor and Luisa's love, challenges him to a duel. El Gallo easily disarms Matt and leaves him embarrassed. Matt and Luisa then argue; she calls him a poseur, while he calls her childish.Matt is eager to leave the provincial town. He and El Gallo discuss his gleaming vision of adventure (""I Can See It""). Henry and Mortimer return and lead Matt off to see the world. A month passes, and the fathers have rebuilt the wall. They meet and speak sadly of their children; Luisa is like a statue and does nothing but sit and dream; Matt still hasn't returned.  They then sing about the uncertainties of raising children, as compared with the reliability of vegetable gardening (""Plant a Radish""). Luisa sees El Gallo watching her and is intrigued by the handsome, experienced bandit. Impulsively, she asks him to take her away to see the world. In a long fantasy sequence, they preview a series of romantic adventures through a mask of unreality, while in the background Matt is being abused and beaten by Henry and Mortimer portraying a series of unpleasant exotic employers. Luisa's fantasies become increasingly frenzied, exhausting and darkly underscored (""Round and Round"").El Gallo tells Luisa to pack her things for the journey, but before she goes inside to do so, he asks her to give him her treasured necklace, a relic of her dead mother, as a pledge that she will return. As she goes inside, El Gallo promises her a world of beauty and grandeur; at the same time, Matt approaches, giving a contrasting version of the cruel experiences that one can suffer (""I Can See It"" (reprise)). As Luisa disappears, El Gallo turns to leave, the injured Matt makes a pitiful attempt to stop him from hurting Luisa, but El Gallo knocks him away and disappears. Luisa returns to find that El Gallo has left with her necklace, and she sits in tears. El Gallo, as the narrator, explains poetically that he had to hurt Matt and Luisa, and also himself in the process. Matt comforts Luisa, and he tells her a little about his experiences, and the two realize that everything they wanted was each other (""They Were You""; ""Metaphor"" (reprise)), but that they now understand that more deeply. The Fathers return joyfully and are about to tear down the wall, when El Gallo reminds them that the wall must always remain (""Try to Remember"" (reprise)).","Sly fathers of families who live in the neighborhood, manipulate their already adult children (respectively a boy and a girl), so that they fell in love. They fake a long-standing feud, and their views on life are shown as completely different philosophy, which is reflected even in how to take care for the garden. The first says that the whole thing is in abundant irrigation, while the second states that in irrigating is important not to overdo it. As it turns out, it's pretty effective policy, since their children really fall in love and met secretly in the attic of their home, where their apartments located. One day, fathers develop genius, in their view, plan to hire a professional who would steal the daughter of one, while the son of second heroically saves her. This would put an end to their ""feud"", and they would love to have consented to the marriage of children. In addition, such an event will solidly pull together the future husband and wife. Generally, it would seem just a heaven on Earth.  They hire some El Gallo and his disheveled henchman disguised as a Native American, to the kidnapping of those, and it should be on the highest level, not sparing anything for their children, neither in money nor in entertainment of the event. One evening, beloved were returning home, cooing, with allusions to the desire of physical contact between them and they were attacked by these two men. Young fellow heroically fights them off, protecting his girlfriend, and eventually attackers flee. Their parents come to the noise and simulate the scene of reconciliation and all embrace. El Gallo collects props scattered around the stage and go away with his partner.  Some time later, after the ban on meeting collapsed and the two families began to talk to each other in open, mutual quarrels and accusations begin to grow. Children try to recreate those sparks that were between them, whereas all find disadvantages of each other. One of the parents recognized that their feud and the theft of the bride were a fake and all start to curse each other, resulting in a fictional feud turned into tangible. The girl calls guy poseur, and he named her too childish. Guy hastily leaves the city and wandering for a long time without going back into it. The girl mope all day sitting at home doing nothing. Fathers, also sad for such a passage, reflect on the heaviness of child-rearing (""Plant a Radish"").  A girl then falls in love with a mature and experienced bandit El Gallo, and in a burst of momentum, wants him to steal her and together they flee to see a big world. In front of the audience, various entertainment scenes begin to slip, then they fade. These two begin to plan departure on the same day and she goes after her belongings while El Gallo asks her neck chain as a pledge that she would return to him, and she gives it.  Returning, she sees that a bandit ran away and she freezes in tears. While her beloved returned, catching her like that and comforting. As a result, these two realize that they have to be together and need each other more than they thought and more than all the adventures of the world. Their fathers are happy to welcome this news."
Once," Act IA thirty-something Dublin busker (identified only as ""Guy"") sings a heartfelt ballad of unrequited love on a Dublin street, accompanying himself on guitar (""Leave""). He then puts his guitar in its case and turns to leave without it; but a young Czech woman (identified only as ""Girl""), who has been listening to him sing, approaches. She asks numerous personal questions about his songs; he replies that he wrote most of them for a girlfriend who broke up with him and moved to New York City.  He is giving up on his music because the memories of his defunct relationship are too painful; he now works as a vacuum cleaner repairman in his father's shop. Girl responds that she has a vacuum that ""does not suck"", and asks him to fix it.  She offers to pay for the repair by playing piano for him.  Over his protests, she snatches the sheet music for a new song from his jacket.  Reluctantly, Guy picks up his guitar and they play the song together (""Falling Slowly"").  Girl suggests that he could win his old girlfriend back by singing her that song.  Guy brushes this off, but Girl reminds him that he now owes her a vacuum repair, so they head to his father's shop (""The North Strand"").As Guy fixes the vacuum, Girl becomes acquainted with his father, who seems to like her.  Once the vacuum is repaired, Guy impulsively invites Girl to his bedroom, above the shop.  They are clearly attracted to each other, but when he attempts to kiss her she stops him and leaves (""The Moon""). The next day he apologises, and they write, rehearse and record songs together. Girl introduces Guy to her family, including her young daughter, Ivanka (""Ej, Pada, Pada, Rosicka""). After Guy leaves, Girl plays one of his songs on the piano, substituting her own lyrics as she thinks of him (""If You Want Me"").The next morning Girl tells Guy that she has arranged a meeting with a banker (""Broken Hearted Hoover Fixer Sucker Guy""). To persuade the bank manager to approve a loan — which would enable Guy to take his music to New York — Guy plays him a song (""Say It to Me Now""). The banker is impressed with his talent, approves the loan, and adds that he can play guitar as well.  He plays a song for them (""Abandoned in Bandon""), and though he is not a very good singer, they invite him to play in the band. The following night at a night club, Guy tells Girl that she has convinced him that his musical career is worth pursuing. Good, she replies, because it is open mic night at the club, and she has signed him up to perform as ""The Hoover Man"".  He is reluctant, but eventually takes the stage. As he sings, it seems that he is now singing to Girl, not his ex-girlfriend (""Gold"").Act IIDuring band practice, one of the musicians gets into an argument with the bank manager; he opposes capitalism, he says, despite the fact that he owns the shop where they are rehearsing.  Guy and Girl retreat to a hill overlooking the city where the two share a brief, tender moment.  Girl tells Guy, in Czech, that she loves him — but when he asks her to translate, she replies, ""It looks like rain"".  Guy realizes that he has fallen in love with Girl, and wonders how he will live without her when he moves to New York (""Sleeping"").The next day the band records a demo for a major record label (""When Your Mind's Made Up""). After receiving praise for their performance, the band members take a break.  Girl remains at the piano, and thinking she is alone, plays one of her own compositions that reveals the depth of her feelings for Guy (""The Hill"").  Guy, who has been listening, compliments her on her song.  He suggests that she and Ivanka move to New York with him, because they clearly have feelings for each other that they cannot ignore.  Girl answers angrily that he cannot feel that way.  Incredulous, Guy asks why; Girl replies that her husband — Ivanka's father — is trying to reconcile with her, and for the sake of their daughter she must consider it (""It Cannot Be About That""). The following morning the band gathers at the hill to voice their hopes for success with the impending album (""Gold (Acapella)"").  Guy asks Girl to spend his last night in Dublin with him; she demurs, because it would only result in ""hanky-panky"", which is a ""bad idea""; but ultimately she agrees to come to the vacuum shop.Back at the shop, Guy plays the demo for his father.  Impressed and moved, he gives Guy money to help him get settled in New York. Then Guy, encouraged by Girl, calls his ex-girlfriend in New York, who is happy about his imminent arrival, and seems willing to give their relationship another try.  A few days later Girl comes home to find a piano with a bright red bow on it — a gift from Guy.  She sheds a few tears, then sits at the piano and sings; as Guy, in his New York apartment, sings the same song (""Falling Slowly (Reprise)"").", 
Jekyll and Hyde," The majority of the show's story has not changed from production to production, but many of the songs have been altered, cut or replaced since the show debuted. Act I The audience is introduced to John Utterson and Sir Danvers Carew, both having been associated with Doctor Henry Jekyll. Utterson was Jekyll's lawyer and best friend while Sir Danvers was Jekyll's future father-in-law. The two gentlemen take the audience back some time to find Jekyll in an insane asylum singing over his comatose father (""Lost in the Darkness""). It is Jekyll's belief that the evil in his father's soul has caused his illness. Jekyll tells the audience about his passion to find out why man is both good and evil and his attempts to separate the good from the evil (""I Need to Know""*).Some time later, the rich and poor of 19th century London describe how people act how they want others to see them, no matter who they really are inside (""Façade""). Afterward, Jekyll presents a research proposal to the Board of Governors of St. Jude's Hospital. Sir Danvers, the chairman of the board, is in attendance along with His Grace Rupert the 14th Bishop of Basingstoke, the Right Honorable Sir Archibald ""Archie"" Proops, Lord Theodore ""Teddy"" Savage, Lady Elizabeth ""Bessie"" Beaconsfield, General Lord Glossop and Simon Stride, the secretary. All, with the exception of Sir Danvers and Stride, are pompous, rich semi-hypocrites. When Jekyll proposes to test his theory and his formula on a human subject (presumably his father), they reject the proposal with cries of ""sacrilege, lunacy, blasphemy, heresy"", voting five to none with Sir Danvers' one abstention (""Board of Governors""). Utterson tries to calm Jekyll down, knowing that he is obsessed over his father's conditions. Jekyll feels that he could ""save"" those who have fallen in the same darkness. Utterson urges his friend, if he feels he is right about his theory, that he should continue (""Pursue the Truth"").Later that night, a group of high society Londoners turns up at Sir Danvers' residence at Regent's Park, which has a well-maintained facade. Sir Danvers throws a showy party for his daughter Emma, for her engagement to Dr. Jekyll, to which Jekyll is late. (""Façade"" (reprise #1).  During the party, the guests - which include the Governors and Stride - mention how worried they are about Emma being engaged to a ""madman,"" but both Sir Danvers and Emma back up Jekyll. Stride, who has feelings for Emma, speaks to Emma in private and tries to reason her out of her engagement, but she quickly turns him down, saying she feels she can be who she wants to be with Jekyll (""Emma's Reasons"").Jekyll arrives late as usual - just before the party leaves to go see the fireworks - and shares a moment with Emma. Though he warns her he may always be busy with his work, Emma swears she will be beside him through it all (""I Must Go On/Take Me as I Am""). Sir Danvers returns as Jekyll leaves and expresses to Emma that he considers Jekyll like a son to him, but finds it difficult to tolerate his behavior at the cost of losing his daughter. Emma assures him that he will never lose her, and they should not be afraid to let go (""Letting Go"").Jekyll and Utterson later go to the dregs of Camden Town known as ""The Red Rat"" for Jekyll's bachelor party (""Façade (reprise #2)""). Prostitute Lucy Harris arrives late and is in for some trouble with the boss, known as 'Spider', but she dismisses it for now. Despite her position in life, she is seen to be kind-hearted and well liked by her co-workers, but has moments of contemplation about her life (""No One Knows Who I Am"").Guinevere, the German manager of ""The Red Rat"", then breaks Lucy's reverie and then sends her out onstage to do her number (""Bring On the Men""**), which captivates Jekyll. After the number, Lucy begins to circulate among the clientele. Spider approaches Lucy and after striking her hard across the face, threatens to kill her if she is late again. Jekyll approaches Lucy after witnessing the Spider's actions and intends to help her as Utterson is led away by another bar girl. Jekyll and Lucy are drawn to each other in a way that promises each of them a great friendship. Jekyll admits Lucy's song has helped him find the answer to his experiment. Utterson reemerges, and Jekyll tells Lucy that he must be on his way. Before he goes, he gives Lucy his visiting card and asks her to see him should she ever need a friend (""Here's to the Night"").As Utterson and Jekyll arrive at the latter's residence, Utterson notices that Jekyll is in a better mood. Jekyll informs him that he has found a subject for his experiments. Utterson recommends that Jekyll go straight to bed and departs. Jekyll dismisses his butler, Poole, for the night and proceeds to his laboratory, excited that the moment has come to conduct his experiment (""This Is the Moment""). Keeping tabs on the experiment in his journal, Jekyll mixes his chemicals to create his formula, HJ7, and injects it into the subject: himself (in some versions, he drinks the formula, as he did in the book). After a minute of the potion's side effects, he writhes in pain, and is taken over by an alternate, aggressive personality (""First Transformation""). With grim humor he notes in his journal ""4:00 AM -A few slight changes"" (the exact line varies, depending on the production). He gleefully goes out and roams the streets, taking in the sights and sounds of London while tormenting innocent bystanders, which includes an abusive encounter with Lucy. Jekyll's alternate personality gives himself a name: Edward Hyde (""Alive"").A week later, no one has heard anything from Jekyll. Emma, Sir Danvers and Utterson ask Poole where he is, but Emma decides to leave and believes Jekyll will come for her after his work is finished. After Emma and Sir Danvers leave, Poole tells Utterson that Jekyll has been locked in his lab all this time and that he has heard strange sounds from the lab. Jekyll, who seems distraught, emerges and impatiently sends Poole to fetch some chemicals for him. Utterson confronts Jekyll about his bizarre behavior, but Jekyll brushes this off. He instead gives Utterson three letters: one for Emma, another for her father, and one for Utterson himself should Jekyll become ill or disappear. Suspicious and concerned, Utterson warns Jekyll to not let his work take over his life. Meanwhile, Emma and Sir Danvers argue about the prudence of Emma's marriage to a man who seems to be falling into an ever-deepening abyss. Emma again tells her father that she understands that Jekyll's work is important (""His Work and Nothing More"").After Utterson departs, Lucy arrives at Jekyll's residence with a nasty bruise on her back. As Jekyll treats her wound, she tells him a man named Hyde inflicted it. Jekyll is stunned by this revelation but hides it. Feeling compassion for Jekyll for being kind to her, Lucy kisses him (""Sympathy, Tenderness""). Disturbed by his own actions, Jekyll leaves Lucy, who wonders about her love for him (""Someone Like You"").Later, the Bishop of Basingstoke is seen with Guinevere after having a ""meeting"" with one of her underage attendants. He pays Guinevere and arranges to see the attendant next Wednesday. When Guinevere and the attendant leave, Hyde appears holding a swordstick with a heavy pewter knob. After insulting the Bishop, Hyde proceeds to beat and stab him to death with the swordstick before gleefully setting the body aflame (""Alive (reprise)""). Act II Utterson and Sir Danvers speak to the audience once again of past events with Jekyll: Utterson begins to feel he was not able to help his poor client and friend, while Danvers senses that something was horribly wrong with his work, as he had not been seen or heard from for weeks.The citizens of London gossip about the Bishop's murder as Hyde hunts down and kills General Glossop, Sir Proops, Lady Beaconsfield, and Lord Savage. By now, all five Governors who rejected Jekyll's proposal are dead (""Murder, Murder""). Later one night, Emma lets herself into Jekyll's laboratory. She finds his journal open and reads one of his entries. Jekyll enters and immediately closes the journal, preventing her from learning what he has become. Emma can see he is distraught. She professes her love for him and begs him to confide in her (""Once Upon a Dream""). He tells her nothing of his work, but says he still loves her. After Emma leaves, Jekyll writes in his journal that Hyde has taken a heavy toll on him and those around him, and that the transformations are occurring of their own accord. His entry is interrupted when Utterson arrives at the lab, seeking to find out who Jekyll's sole heir is, Edward Hyde, as referred to in Jekyll's letter. Jekyll only tells him that Hyde is a ""colleague"" involved in the experiment. Utterson can see that his friend is desperately ill and agrees to obtain the rest of the chemicals Jekyll requires. Jekyll, once again alone, begins to face the fact that Hyde is a part of him (""Obsession""). At the same time, both Lucy and Emma wonder about their love for the same man (""In His Eyes"").At ""The Red Rat"", Nellie and Lucy consider their profession and why they keep doing it (""Girls Of The Night""). Lucy is then visited by Hyde, who tells her that he is going away for a while. He then warns her to never leave him. Lucy is terrified, but seems to be held under a sexual, animalistic control by Hyde (""Dangerous Game""). As they leave together, Spider addresses the ""Red Rat"" attendants, warning them to always be aware of what dangers lie ahead in the East End (""Façade (reprise #3)"").Utterson comes to Jekyll's lab with the rest of the chemicals and a secret envelope and discovers Hyde, who informs him that the doctor is ""not available"" tonight. Utterson refuses to leave the package with anyone but his friend and demands to know where he is. Hyde replies that even if he told him, Utterson would not believe him. When Utterson insists to see Jekyll or he will alert the police.  Hyde angrily attempts to attack Utterson who threatens him with his swordstick. Trapped, Hyde injects the formula into himself, roaring with laughter as he reverts to Jekyll in front of an appalled Utterson. Jekyll tells Utterson that Hyde must be destroyed, whatever the cost. He then begs Utterson to deliver money for Lucy so she can escape to safety. As Utterson leaves, Jekyll mixes in chemicals and injects the new formula, fearing that he might lose himself forever, and praying that he can restore his former life (""The Way Back"").Utterson visits Lucy at ""The Red Rat"" with the money, along with a letter from Jekyll that entreats her to leave town and start a new life elsewhere. After Utterson leaves, Lucy wonders of the possibilities ahead (""A New Life""). Just then, Hyde returns. Seeing the letter from Jekyll, he tells Lucy that he and the doctor are ""very close"" and that they ""share everything"". In some versions it's then made clear that, Hyde reveals that he feels that Lucy has betrayed him by being in love with Jekyll and by going to see him everyday while in others it's not. He then calls Lucy over to him and holds her very close. As he holds Lucy softly so that she does not suspect it, he slowly, angrily and savagely stabs her multiple times before slitting her throat (""Sympathy, Tenderness (reprise)""). The vile murderer runs off laughing, just as the ""Red Rat"" attendants find Lucy's body and carry her out on a stretcher. Covered in Lucy's blood, Jekyll returns to his laboratory and faces off with Hyde in a final battle for control (""Confrontation"").Later, Utterson tells the audience that Jekyll had given up his task of ""finding the truth,"" condemning his father to the darkness. Yet, as Sir Danvers would put it, the doctor had returned at ""the sound of wedding bells"" (""Façade (reprise #4)""). Several weeks later, Jekyll seems to have regained control as he and Emma stand before the priest at their wedding in St. Anne's Church. As the Minister begins the ceremony, Jekyll doubles over in pain and transforms into Hyde. Hyde then kills Stride, a guest at the wedding, before taking Emma hostage. At the sound of Emma's pleading voice, Jekyll is able to regain momentary control. He begs Utterson to kill him, but Utterson cannot bring himself to harm his friend. Desperate, Jekyll impales himself on Utterson's swordstick. Emma weeps softly as Jekyll dies, finally free of Hyde's evil control (""Finale"").(*) ""I Need to Know"" was removed for the Broadway production, but featured in all other productions (in some cases it replaces ""Lost in the Darkness"").

Mad scientists, who claim to morality – completely sad. As in any classic story of a similar nature, the viewer gets to the late years of twentieth century, when science already actively moved forward, and the human imagination and the fears creep out in the form of musicals, films and books.  This story begins with the reasoning of the protagonist of good and evil, about dichotomy, inseparable confrontation of polar things, harmoniously coexisting in the human soul, and their struggle. The separation of these things on the components could fix the world, to deprive it of the root of all evil – the human one. But only in theory. The protagonist, a doctor named Jekyll, is a young and expressive scientist. He is charming and clever, handsome and successful, his ideas are felicitous in society. Best Jekyll’s friend is lawyer named John Utterson. In the beginning, he tells to beholders about the doctor’s life, work and social importance of this person.  Then the action takes us back in time to the hospital ward for the mentally ill, where the bed is taken by a father of this brilliant doctor. He is paralyzed and mentally ill. Jekyll believes that in the illness of his parents the evil is responsible that filled his soul. If he can separate particles of evil, he will be able to heal not only his father, but all Mankind. (In the matter of fact, he never asked Humanity – does it want to be cured?).  Evil, greedy, hypocritical people scurry around the streets of London, storing in the souls the darkness and anger, trying to hide all goodness and real, to exhibit only what pleases the public. It oppresses the doctor. At a meeting of the Governing Board of the hospital, Dr. Jekyll releases his ideas on the research plan. He offers to arrange an experiment on a living person to prove his theory, but all these people are typical representatives of secular society, hypocritical, rich, artificially brilliant. All except Mr. Danvers, the future father-in-law of Jekyll. Board members burst into exclamations of blasphemy and sacrilege, the complete insanity of the doctor, and refuse him in five of six votes. Jekyll is upset that his idea has failed.  That same evening, Mr. Danvers arranges reception on occasion of the wedding of the doctor with his daughter Emma, after which Jekyll and Utterson go to the pub with a dubious reputation, to spend a baccalaurean party. One of the main parts, is played by Lucy the prostitute, who afterwards immediately goes to Jekyll. Utterson is lead away by another girl, and young people soon stay alone. After some time after a long conversation, interrupting a kiss of doctor and prostitute, Utterson arrives, Jekyll and he leave the pub, but Jekyll manages to give a business card to a girl. On the way home excited Jekyll tells his friend that finally found his object for study, but Utterson, thinking it was just intoxicating delirium, sends a doctor to sleep. Since then, Dr. Jekyll works very hard to create a serum that will separate the good from the evil in human person to show it out. Develops to use it on himself. A few minutes separated the doctor from becoming a humanoid monster, in which he has turned. The name of this monster is Hyde.  Hyde became a separate personality of Jekyll, embodying all his hatred and the darkest ideas: he killed all the members of the Board and a prostitute, who was in love with the doctor. Hyde became a separate creature, not connected with the doctor anyhow, and they face a long struggle for supremacy in the body. Hyde, as the evil, was defeated and bound by Jekyll, but at the cost of his life, when at a wedding of Jekyll, Hyde brakes out, and the doctor, snatching a few seconds of consciousness, ordered to Utterson to shoot him."
Beautiful: the Carole King Musical," From the Beautiful: The Carole King Musical cast recording booklet Act I At Carnegie Hall in 1971, Carole King sings ""So Far Away"". Then, in Brooklyn 1958, 16-year-old Carole tells her mother, Genie, she is going into Manhattan to try to sell a song to music publisher Donnie Kirshner. In the long tradition of mothers, Genie is opposed to her daughter's wish and in the equally long tradition of teenagers not caring about their mother's opinion, Carole goes anyway. At 1650 Broadway, she hears the ""1650 Broadway Medley"". She then sings her new song ""It Might As Well Rain Until September"". Donnie says he will take it and hopes she has others. At Queens College, Carole meets a handsome young lyricist named Gerry Goffin. They agree to collaborate, musically and romantically, which in both cases turns out to be a fertile arrangement. When they go to Donnie's to play their new song, Carole confesses to Gerry that she is pregnant. Gerry asks her to marry him. It gives her an extra depth of feeling when she sings their new song for Donnie, ""Some Kind of Wonderful"", which The Drifters then record.They get an office at 1650. While there, Carole meets a new lyricist Cynthia Weil (""Happy Days Are Here Again""), who is looking for a composer to work with. Gerry and Carole sing their new song ""Take Good Care of My Baby"", during which Barry Mann, the composer with the office next door, enters. Barry meets Cynthia and they decide to collaborate. As they begin to work, sparks fly. Donnie tells them he needs a song for the Shirelles. The couples compete for the job. In Donnie's office the next morning, Carole and Gerry present ""Will You Love Me Tomorrow"". Cynthia and Barry perform ""He's Sure the Boy I Love"". Donnie picks Carole and Gerry's song for The Shirelles and it goes to no. 1. And so, on either side of the same wall, a competition is born. The two teams turn out an amazing parade of songs: ""Up on the Roof"", ""On Broadway"", ""The Loco-Motion"" and ""You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'"".Gerry and Carole are at the taping of a TV special where their new song, ""One Fine Day"", is being performed by the dazzling Janelle Woods. During a break, Gerry confesses to Carole that he is restless in their marriage. He wants to sleep with Janelle, and he doesn't want to lie about it. Carole is stunned. As the song begins again, she takes it over and sings it herself. Act II Carole is in a recording studio doing a demo of ""Chains"". Gerry is off with Janelle but tells her he will meet her later. Nick, a guitarist, asks Carole to come sing at the Bitter End sometime but she declines — she's a songwriter, not a singer. The thing with Gerry is getting her down so she goes and talks to Cynthia who is also having trouble with Barry — they split up. Carole decides to tell Gerry he has to end the affair with Janelle. As she leaves, Barry comes in. He and Cynthia make up and play their new song, ""Walking in the Rain"". Gerry shows up, but he is not making sense. He eventually has a breakdown. At the hospital, he tells Carole he will end the affair with Janelle and that he wants to come home. She suggests they make a new start and move to the suburbs (""Pleasant Valley Sunday"").Barry, Cynthia and Donnie come to see the new house. Barry plays their new song, ""We Gotta Get Out of This Place"". Depressed that he and Carole can't do as well, Gerry leaves in a funk for the city. While he is gone, it comes out that Barry and Cynthia have seen him with another woman, a singer named Marilyn Wald. Carole goes to Marilyn's apartment and Gerry is there. It's the final straw, and she ends their marriage. At the Bitter End, where Barry and Cynthia hear their song ""Uptown"", Carole explains she went to Los Angeles for a vacation and has started writing on her own. Nick, the guitarist from the studio who asked her to sing with his group, is playing there and urges her to sing. She sings her new song, ""It's Too Late"". She decides to move to Los Angeles. At 1650, she says goodbye to Donnie, Barry and Cynthia and plays them a parting present ""You've Got a Friend"".In Los Angeles, she records her album, Tapestry. The session goes well until the last song, which she is afraid to sing. It's a song she wrote with Gerry and she is afraid of the feelings it may stir up. Her producer, Lou Adler, persuades her. She sings ""(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman"". The album is a smash. Carole is at Carnegie Hall for her concert, and is met by Gerry, who apologizes for the way he mistreated her in the past and gives her a final prediction - ""you're going all the way"". Carole takes to the piano, and performs for her audience.","Carole King, after whose name a musical is called, is a girl from Brooklyn, according to the play (but really, she is from Manhattan in the real life), is a songwriter, whose soul is restless. She goes to Manhattan, to write her songs and to sell them. She meets the producer named Donnie Kirshner and he likes her first song, buys it without delay and wants to work with her further. Inspired, Carole meets lyricist named Gerry. They begin to work together and Carole soon becomes pregnant, about what reports to Gerry. They decide to get married and this happens. After that, they met another girl, and then a young man who falls in love with the newly met girl, and they have sparkling new creative pair, who also writes the lyrics and music and competes with Gerry and Carole. Music of the latter more popular and this only adds to the spirit of competition between the pairs and they soon feel the rise in their careers – their music is popular among performers. But their marriage did not expect success – Gerry says that marriage inconvenienced him and wants to meet with other women, completely emptying Carole with his statement.  Gerry meets another woman, but does not find the happiness and offers Carole to start over & move to the suburbs. They begin to search a house, but they would not succeed, as well as in the restoration of relations. Gerry leaves and dates another woman. When Carole comes to her house, she meets there Gerry and breaks with him. Full of anger and despair, she decides to move to Los Angeles, to re-start her career as a solo writer. She speaks to one familiar guitarist, who encourages her and so she begins to sing. In LA, she recorded a solo album, and the last song – which was co-written with her last husband – she have no enough guts to do, until her producer convinces her that all is well and she must try. Gerry suddenly appears and apologizes for all the pain he had caused her and she is now in very balanced inner state, supporting her first album at Carnegie Hall with the song ""Beautiful""."
Brigadoon," Act INew Yorkers Tommy Albright and Jeff Douglas have travelled to the Scottish Highlands on a game-hunting vacation, but they get lost on their first night out. They begin to hear music (""Brigadoon"") coming from a nearby village that does not appear on their map of the area. They head over there to get directions back to their inn and find a fair in progress (""McConnachy Square""), with villagers dressed in traditional Scottish tartan. Andrew MacLaren and his daughters arrive at the fair to purchase supplies for younger daughter Jean's wedding to Charlie Dalrymple. Harry Beaton, son of Archie Beaton, is madly in love with Jean and is depressed at the thought of her marrying another, unable to find comfort in Maggie Anderson's devotion to him. One of the girls asks Jean's older sister Fiona when she'll marry, and Fiona answers she's waiting for the right person (""Waitin' For My Dearie"").Tommy and Jeff wander into the village and ask where they are; Archie informs them that they are in ""Brigadoon"". Fiona invites the wanderers to have a meal and rest at the MacLaren home. Flirtatious dairymaid Meg Brockie immediately takes a liking to Jeff and leads him off. Charlie Dalrymple appears, rejoicing in his impending nuptials. He shares a drink with Tommy, toasting to a Mr. Forsythe whom he thanks for ""postponing the miracle"". When Tommy asks what that means, Fiona shushes him and leads him away as Charlie celebrates the end of his bachelorhood (""Go Home with Bonnie Jean""). Tommy tells Fiona that he has a fiancée, Jane, in New York, but he's in no hurry to marry her, and Fiona reveals that she likes Tommy very much. Tommy insists on accompanying Fiona to gather heather for the wedding (""The Heather on the Hill""). Meanwhile, Meg takes Jeff to a place in the forest with a shack and a cot. She tells him she's ""highly attracted"" to him, but he spurns her advances, wanting only to sleep. She reflects on her 'eventful' love life (""The Love Of My Life"").At the MacLarens', Jean's friends help her pack her things to move into Charlie's home (""Jeannie's Packin' Up""). Charlie arrives to sign the MacLarens' family Bible. He wants to see Jean; told that it's bad luck to see her on the wedding day, he begs for her to come out anyway (""Come to Me, Bend to Me""). Tommy and Fiona return with a basket full of heather, and Fiona goes upstairs to help Jean dress for the wedding. Jeff arrives wearing a pair of Highland trews (trousers); apparently his own pants have been damaged on a ""thistle"". Jeff finds that Tommy is so happy that he can barely contain it (""Almost Like Being In Love""). Tommy notices that all the events listed in the family Bible, including Jean's wedding, are listed as if they had happened 200 years earlier. When he asks Fiona about this, she sends him to the schoolmaster, Mr. Lundie.Fiona, Tommy, and Jeff arrive at Mr. Lundie's home, where he relates a story that the two New Yorkers can hardly believe: to protect Brigadoon from being changed by the outside world, 200 years ago the local minister prayed to God to have Brigadoon disappear, only to reappear for one day every 100 years. All citizens of Brigadoon are forbidden to leave the town, or it will disappear forever. Tommy asks hypothetically if an outsider could be permitted to stay. Mr. Lundie replies, ""A stranger can stay if he loves someone here – not jus' Brigadoon, mind ye, but someone in Brigadoon – enough to want to give up everythin' an' stay with that one person. Which is how it should be. 'Cause after all, lad, if ye love someone deeply, anythin' is possible.""The group leaves to go to the wedding, which opens with the clans coming in from the hills. Mr. Lundie marries Charlie and Jean, and they perform a traditional celebratory wedding dance. Sword dancers appear, led by Harry, and they perform an elaborate dance over their weapons. All the town joins in the dance, but it abruptly halts when Jean screams as Harry tries to kiss her. In anguish over Jean's wedding, he announces that he's leaving the town (which would end the miracle, causing Brigadoon to disappear forever into the Highland mists) and sprints away.Act IIThe men of the town, including Tommy and a reluctant Jeff, frantically try to find Harry before he can depart the town (""The Chase""). Suddenly an agonized scream is heard. Harry, who appears to have fallen on a rock and crushed his skull, is found dead by the other men. Deciding not to tell the rest of the town until the next morning, the men carry Harry's body away. Fiona and her father arrive to see if everything is all right. As Mr. MacLaren leaves, Tommy sees Fiona, and they embrace. She reveals her love for him, and he tells her he believes he feels the same way (""There But For You Go I""). Fiona reminds him that the end of the day is near, and Tommy tells her he wants to stay in Brigadoon with her. They go to find Mr. Lundie.Meanwhile, in the village, Meg tells about the day her parents were drunkenly married (""My Mother's Wedding Day""), and the townsfolk dance until the sound of Highland pipes pierces the air. The gaiety is interrupted as Archie Beaton enters carrying Harry's body, led by the pipers playing a pìobaireachd. Maggie, who loved Harry, performs a funeral dance for her unrequited love. The men of Brigadoon help Archie carry his son to the burial place.Tommy finds Jeff and announces his intention to stay. Jeff thinks the idea is absurd and argues with Tommy until he has convinced him that Brigadoon is only a dream. Jeff also reveals that he tripped Harry and accidentally killed him. Fiona and Mr. Lundie arrive, and Tommy, shaken by Jeff's confession, tells Fiona that he loves her, but he can't stay; he still has doubts (""From This Day On""). Fiona tells Tommy, as she fades away into darkness, that she will love him forever.Four months later, Jeff is drinking heavily at a hotel bar in New York. Tommy, who has been living on a farm in New Hampshire, enters and greets Jeff. Tommy is still in love with Fiona and cannot stop thinking about her. His fiancée Jane Ashton, a beautiful socialite, talks to him about their impending wedding, but everything she says causes him to hear Fiona's voice and dream of Brigadoon (""Come to Me, Bend to Me"" (reprise) and ""Heather on the Hill"" (reprise)). Tommy tells Jane that he cannot marry her, and she argues with him, but he continues to daydream about his true love (""Go Home With Bonnie Jean"" (reprise) and ""From This Day On"" (reprise)). Jane leaves, and Tommy tells Jeff that he wants to return to Scotland, although he knows the village will not be there.Tommy and Jeff return to the spot where they found Brigadoon and, as they expected, see nothing there.  Just as they turn to leave, they hear the music again (""Brigadoon""), and Mr. Lundie appears and says, ""My my! You must really love her. You woke me up!"" Tommy waves goodbye to Jeff and disappears with Mr. Lundie into the Highland mist to be reunited with Fiona.","A distinctive feature of this musical is a fairly large number of actors. First, we meet a couple of travelers from New York, Tommy and Jeff, who lost in Scottish forests when hanging there. They heard the voice that sang a charming song ""Brigadoon"" and went to it, came to the village with the same name. The voice belonged to a young girl that sang it in response to a question, when she will marry, that her friends asked. She said she is waiting for the right person. While her younger sister is just about to get married and the father goes to town to buy supplies for the upcoming event.  Two newcomers stay in a local hotel and one of them really liked by the local milkmaid, who immediately spots him. Then they go on a picnic in the woods, but he rejects her claim without expressing the desire to become her boyfriend.  One of the newcomers notices that his Bible dated 200 years before this year, and being interested in it, asks the innkeeper's daughter about and in the response, she sends him to the local schoolmaster. He tells an amazing story. Once upon a time, the local mayor wished very much that his city was removed from the influence on the environment, so not to deteriorate and not to spoil. Due to some strong magic, this wish has come true, but in a peculiar way – the city was gone from the real world and returns just for 1 day every century. During this day, anyone can enter, but none of its inhabitants can get out of it, otherwise the city will be gone forever. The newcomer can stay in it if he strongly enough loves someone from the city to stay in it forever.  One of the residents, being in love with a girl that is about to marry, telling everyone that he is leaving the city because of the inability to accept this wedding and some time later he is found with fractured skull, obviously falling from the local rock. Tommy wants to stay in town forever, loving local woman, Fiona. Tommy tells his friend that he had killed a local and a friend convinces Tommy that staying in the city is not the best idea. He tells his doubts to Fiona & she responds that she will always love him.  4 months later, Tommy drinks heavily and sees Fiona in every woman, even in his bride, who abandons him because of this obsession. They decide to go back to the Brigadoon, though did not expect to see anything there. City really was not there, but, to their surprise, a local schoolmaster came out of the mist, saying that his love has opened a portal to the city and takes him to the fog, so he will be reunited with his Fiona forever."
On the Town," summary Act IA quartet of dockyard workers mourn the start of a new work day (""I Feel Like I'm Not Out of Bed Yet""). The whistle blows at 6AM, and three sailors emerge: Ozzie, Chip, and Gabey, excited for 24 hours of shore leave (""New York, New York""). Chip is excited to see all the sights that his father told him about after his trip to New York in 1934, with his decade-old guidebook by his side. Ozzie is interested in finding a date (or several) because Manhattan women are the prettiest in the world. Gabey is looking for one special girl, hopefully one who reminds him of his 7th grade girlfriend, Minnie Frenchley. On the subway, the three spot a poster of Ivy Smith, ""Miss Turnstiles"" for the month of June. Gabey, overcome with love for the picture, takes it with him. An old lady angrily tells him that she will have him arrested for vandalism, and the three run off.Gabey wants to meet Ivy Smith, despite Chip's protests that the city is too big for things like that to happen. Ozzie, recounting an incident where Gabey saved their lives, convinces Chip to help Gabey find her. Chip grudgingly agrees and Ozzie coaches Gabey on what to do once he meets Ivy (""Gabey's Comin',"" performed in the 2014 Broadway revival). The three break up, Gabey to Carnegie Hall, Ozzie to the Museum of Modern Art, and Chip to the ""subway people."" The three imagine what Miss Turnstiles must be like, and a ballet is performed in which Ivy demonstrates all the many different, contradictory, skills she has.The little old lady finds a policeman, and the two chase after the sailors.A young female cabbie named Hildy is found asleep in her cab by her irate boss S. Uperman. He fires her and tells her to return the cab in an hour or he will call the police. Looking for one last fare, she comes across Chip. It's love at first sight, at least for Hildy. She forcefully kisses Chip, but Chip wants nothing more than to find Ivy. Hildy tempts him into taking a tour of the city, but all the places he wants to go (the Hippodrome, the Forrest Theatre to see Tobacco Road, the New York City Aquarium, and the Woolworth Building) are either no longer in existence or no longer notable. The only place Hildy wants to take Chip is her apartment (""Come Up to My Place""). Mr. Uperman joins the lady and the cop in the chase, implying Hildy stole the cab.Ozzie goes to the museum, but mistakenly arrives at the Museum of Natural History instead of the Museum of Modern Art. There he meets a budding anthropologist, Claire de Loone. She is amazed at his resemblance to a prehistoric man, and asks him for his measurements. He mistakes her scientific interest for romantic interest, but as she explains, she is engaged to be married to the famous Judge Pitkin W. Bridgework. Pitkin has taught her to learn to know men scientifically, but she, like Ozzie, often gets ""Carried Away."" The two of them accidentally knock over a dinosaur. Waldo Figment, the professor who built the dinosaur, joins Uperman, the cop, and the lady in the chase.Gabey mopes around the city. Without love, New York is nothing but a ""Lonely Town.""At Carnegie Hall, Ivy Smith is taking lessons from Madame Dilly, a drunk who clearly has no knowledge of vocal training. Ivy is not quite as glamorous as the Miss Turnstiles contest has made her out to be. In reality, while she is studying to do all the things they said she was, she is nothing more than a ""cooch dancer"" at Coney Island. When Madame Dilly leaves to refill her flask, Gabey enters. He asks Ivy to go out with him, and to his surprise, she accepts. Gabey leaves ecstatically. Madame Dilly advises Ivy to break the date as ""sex and art don't mix"" (""Carnegie Hall Pavane"")Ozzie accompanies Claire back to her apartment, where he meets Claire's fiancé, Pitkin W. Bridgework. They try desperately to explain what they are doing together, but Pitkin does not mind (""I Understand""). He leaves them alone to go to a meeting, reminding Claire that they are to meet at Diamond Eddie's to celebrate their engagement. The two take advantage of their alone time (""Carried Away (reprise)"")Hildy brings Chip and an armful of groceries back to her apartment, promising to cook for him. Chip insists that he must leave to find Ivy. She tells him to call the IRT, but they refuse to give Chip her address or phone number. He decides that he has tried hard enough, and he and Hildy attempt to get physical when her roommate, Lucy Schmeeler, home from work with a cold, intrudes. Hildy finally gets rid of her by convincing her to go to an air-cooled movie. Hildy seduces Chip, bragging about her many talents, not the least of which is her cooking (""I Can Cook Too"").Gabey's attitude has done a full 180, and he feels ""Lucky to Be Me."" Ivy, about to meet Gabey at Nedick's, runs into Madame Dilly, who reminds her that if she doesn't do her cooch dance that night, she'll be fired, and won't be able to pay to Madame Dilly for her lessons. Madame Dilly threatens to smear her reputation, and she is forced to stand Gabey up.Chip and Ozzie both arrive at Nedick's with Hildy and Claire both dressed as Ivy Smith. Gabey isn't fooled, and tells them the story of how he met her. Just then, Madame Dilly arrives with a message from Ivy: she will not be coming because she instead elected to go to a fancy party. Gabey is alone and dejected, but Hildy tells him that she can get him a date: Lucy. The five go into a dance demonstrating the nightlife of the city.Act IIAt Diamond Eddie's, the dancers perform a number (""So Long Baby""). Gabey is still hung up on Miss Turnstiles, and Lucy hasn't shown up yet. A singer, Diana Dream, performs a very sad song, ""I Wish I Was Dead,"" which causes Gabey to feel even sadder. Lucy calls, having accidentally gone to the Diamond Eddie's in Yonkers. The group decides to go to the Congacabana at the suggestion of Claire, but on their way out, they run into Pitkin. Ozzie and Claire try to explain the situation, but as before, all Pitkin says is ""I Understand (reprise)."" The gang leaves for the Congacabana while Pitkin stays behind to pay the check.At the Congacabana, Dolores Dolores (the same performer as ""Diana Dream"") sings the same sad song as before, in Spanish. Hildy interrupts her, saying she had gotten a request to sing. Hildy, as well as Ozzie, Claire, and Chip, try to lift Gabey's spirits by reminding him that he can count on them (""Ya Got Me""). As they are about to depart for another nightclub, the Slam Bang Club, Pitkin arrives (""I Understand (reprise)""). Claire tells him once again to pay the check, also to wait for Lucy and come to the Slam Bang later.At the Slam Bang Club, Madame Dilly is in a drunken stupor. Gabey asks her where Ivy is, and she lets it slip that she is at Coney Island. Gabey runs off to find her. Chip and Ozzie, afraid that he won't be able to get back to the ship on time, rush after him. On their way out, they come across Lucy and Pitkin. Claire once again leaves him to go with Ozzie. Pitkin recalls all the times in his life that he ""understood"" and realizes he's been played the fool by everyone, including Claire (""Pitkin's Song (I Understand)""). He also bonds with Lucy and the two of them join the chase along with the little old lady, the police officers, Figment, and Uperman.Riding the Subway, Gabey dreams about Coney Island and Ivy. An extended dance sequence occurs with Ivy and a dream Gabey in a boxing match (""Subway Ride/The Great Lover Displays Himself/The Imaginary Coney Island"").The other four have just missed Gabey and are riding another subway car. They wonder about their future after the men have to go back to the ship (""Some Other Time"").At Coney Island, Ivy, along with several other girls, dances in a show called Rajah Bimmy's Harem Scarem (""The Real Coney Island""). Gabey sees Ivy and accidentally tears her already skimpy outfit off. She is arrested for indecent exposure as the chasers arrive and demand the others be arrested. Claire hopes Pitkin will get her out of the situation, but he no longer trusts her and has the three men brought to the naval authorities. The girls ask Pitkin if he's ever ""committed an indiscretion,"" which he staunchly refuses. Just then, he sneezes in the same way as Lucy Schmeeler, casting doubt on his claim.As the clock chimes six, the sailors prepare to get back on the ship. Just then, the girls come running to them, telling them that Pitkin understood. They say a fond farewell as three new sailors leave the ship, eager to have their own adventures in New York City (""New York, New York (reprise)/Finale Act II"").","In 1944, three sailors received a daily vacation. Chip wanted to see the sights of New York. Ozzie wanted to find a girlfriend. Gabey wanted to meet the girl, similar to his classmate. Near the subway, sailors saw a poster with Ivy Smith – ‘Miss Turnstile’ in June. When Gabey tore a picture off, he was scolded by an old woman. She said that the sailor would be arrested for vandalism. Trinity ran away from the crime scene. Gabey wanted to meet Ivy Smith & comrades decided to help him in this. Sailors went to different places, hoping to find a girl. The old woman called police & they began to look for violators.  Taxi driver Hildy was caught by her boss sleeping in the car. The man kicked her out & told to come back in an hour. Soon a girl met Chip & fell in love with him. Kiss had no effect on a sailor – he was looking for Ivy. Hildy invited him to tour around the city, but the places that the man wanted to visit, were either destroyed or were not in their best shape. She wanted to bring a guy to her place. At this time, possessor of the vehicle decided that the driver had stolen it. He joined the old woman & the police in the chase.  Ozzie was searching for Ivy at the Museum, but accidentally entered in the Natural History’s Museum. There sailor met Claire. The anthropologist was struck by similarity of person with primitive man. She asked for permission to measure him. He made a mistake by adopting scientific curiosity for love one. The woman explained that she was engaged. Claire & Ozzie accidentally destroyed the dino. Professor, who had gathered his skeleton, chased them, joining the old woman, the police & owner of the cab.  A girl from the poster took vocal lessons. In fact, she was not so glamorous, how the contest portrayed her. She performed erotic dances. As soon as the teacher left, in the hall appeared Gabey. The sailor was struck, when received consent from Ivy to go out. After conducting Claire to hers place, Ozzie met there with her fiancé. The judge did not believe in their explanation of why they had come together. He reminded Claire, that soon they would have a meeting & left. Hildy led Chip home. Girl seduced a sailor with her talents – especially culinary ones.  Ivy was going to relax with Gabey. But then Madame Dilly said that the girl should go to work. Otherwise, she would be fired & would not receive a fee for training. The girl was forced to leave the sailor be. Chip & Ozzie have brought to Nedick’s bar their girlfriends, dressed as Ivy. But they were not able to cheat a friend – the sailor told about a meeting with a true girl. Madame Dilly came & said that Ivy would not come on a date. Hildy promised to invite a girlfriend for Gabey. The company went after Lucy to another club. There they met a judge who once again did not take Claire’s explanation. Gabey soon learned that Ivy would be performing at Coney Island. He immediately went there with his friends behind him.  Ivy performed dance of concubine from harem of Maharaja. When she saw Gabey, he accidentally broke the meager outfit of a girl. Ivy was arrested for indecent exposure. Then the terrible pursuers came. They demanded the arrest of sailors for breaches. The girls asked the judge, who joined the pursuit, whether he made mistakes. A negative response of the man was interrupted by his sneeze. The judge could catch could only by very close contact with Lucy – only she had a runny nose from all present. As a result, the judge’s accusations looked untenable. Saying goodbye to beloved ones, the sailors returned to the ship on time."
The Who's Tommy," Note that there are several plot differences between the album, the film, and the stage production, though the general storyline is largely the same. Prologue An opening montage of London is presented, beginning in 1940 with the initial meeting and then marriage of the Walkers. Amidst World War II, the husband, Captain Walker, parachutes into Germany, where he is captured as a prisoner of war by the Nazis (""Overture""). Back in London at 22 Heathfield Gardens, the captain's brother Ernie delivers a care package to the pregnant Mrs Walker just as two officers arrive at the home to announce the disappearance and presumed death of her husband (""Captain Walker""). Act I The following year, two nurses gently hand Mrs Walker her newborn son, Tommy; later, in 1945, American troops liberate Captain Walker's POW camp, proclaiming the end of the war (""It's a Boy"" / ""We've Won""). Mrs Walker has since attained a new lover, and they celebrate her twenty-first birthday and discuss marriage together with four-year-old Tommy (""Twenty-One""). To their surprise, Captain Walker enters the house and a fight erupts between Captain Walker and the boyfriend. Mrs Walker turns Tommy away, but he watches his father shoot the boyfriend to death through a large mirror. Captain and Mrs Walker embrace but soon realise what Tommy has witnessed, and violently shake him, telling him he did not see or hear anything (""What About the Boy""). The police arrive; Tommy simply gazes at the mirror in silence. A narrator—Tommy's older self—appears to the audience, introducing and framing the story of his exceptional childhood (""Amazing Journey"").Captain Walker is tried for murder but found not guilty by reasons of self-defense. However, Tommy fails to celebrate his father's release, and his family quickly realizes that he has apparently gone deaf, mute, and blind. Tommy's parents have him undergo a battery of medical tests, to no avail (""Sparks""). At ten years of age, Tommy's unresponsive state remains unchanged (""Amazing Journey – Reprise""). The Walkers all go to church and host a Christmas family dinner, though the family is unnerved that Tommy does not know that it is Christmas or understand its significance (""Christmas""). Everyone is stunned when Tommy responds only to his uncle Ernie's playing the French horn. Mr Walker, in a desperate attempt to reach his son, shouts ""Tommy, can you hear me?"" multiple times. Older Tommy, only visible to young Tommy, who persistently stares at the mirror, sings to him (""See Me, Feel Me"").The Walkers leave Tommy with a slew of vicious babysitters, including alcoholic and sexually abusive Uncle Ernie (""Do You Think It's Alright?"" and ""Fiddle About""), as well as his cousin Kevin, a sadistic bully (""Cousin Kevin""). Cousin Kevin and his friends take Tommy to a youth club where, to everyone's astonishment, Tommy plays pinball brilliantly (""Sensation""). Meanwhile, another doctor, a psychiatrist, tests Tommy yet again with no success (""Sparks – Reprise""). The desperate Captain Walker is approached by The Hawker and Harmonica Player (""Eyesight to the Blind"") who promise a miraculous cure for Tommy. They take young Tommy to the Isle of Dogs to find a prostitute called The Gypsy, who tries to convince Captain Walker to let her spend time alone with Tommy, introducing him to drugs (""The Acid Queen""). Horrified by her methods, Captain Walker snatches Tommy away. By 1958, Tommy has apparently become a pinball-playing expert as Cousin Kevin and a group of adolescents await 17-year-old Tommy's appearance at the amusement arcade, where his rise to local popularity has begun (""Pinball Wizard""). Act II By 1960, Tommy has become the local pinball champion and hero of the neighborhood lads (""Underture""). Captain Walker persists unsuccessfully in seeking doctors and a cure for Tommy (""There's a Doctor"" and ""Go to the Mirror!""). One doctor discovers that Tommy's senses do function but not at a self-aware or openly expressive level. On the street, a group of local louts surround Tommy (""Tommy, Can You Hear Me?"") and carry him home. The Walkers, at their wits' end, passionately confront each other in an effort to reconcile and face the reality that Tommy might never be cured (""I Believe My Own Eyes""). Captain Walker leaves Mrs. Walker with Tommy. Tommy stares into the mirror blankly as his mother tries desperately to reach him one last time, before smashing the mirror in a rage (""Smash the Mirror""). With the mirror in pieces, Tommy suddenly becomes fully lucid and interactive for the first time since the age of four, and he leaves home (""I'm Free""). Through 1961 to 1963, news of Tommy's miraculous regaining of full consciousness receives huge media attention (""Miracle Cure""), Tommy is idolized by the public and the press (""Sensation – Reprise""), and he begins appearing in packed stadiums, playing pinball with a helmet that temporarily blinds and deafens him (""Pinball Wizard – Reprise""). Uncle Ernie tries to capitalise on Tommy's newfound stardom, by selling cheap souvenirs for a grand opening party of Tommy's new holiday camp, resulting from Tommy's cult-like following (""Tommy's Holiday Camp""). That night, an adolescent fan named Sally Simpson falls from the stage in her eagerness to touch Tommy and is pummeled by guards (""Sally Simpson""). Tommy, in horror, stops the show and tends to Sally. He says he has had enough and decides to go home.Realizing how caught up in celebrity he has become, Tommy wishes to do something in return for his fans and invites them all back to his house (""Welcome""). Once there, the population of fans keeps growing, though Tommy generously, but naïvely, wishes to welcome everyone equally. Sally then asks Tommy how she can be more like him and less like herself (""Sally Simpson's Question""). He is confused, and insists that there is no reason for anyone to be like him, when everyone else already possesses the amazing gifts that he was deprived of most of his life. He suddenly realises that he had thought his fame came from his miraculous recovery, when it in fact arose due to his fans desire for a spiritual leader, hoping he could communicate wisdom from his experience of not being able to hear, see, or talk for so long. Now, disenchanted with their hero for failing to provide the answers they wanted to be told to them, the crowd turns on him in anger and eventually leaves (""We're Not Gonna Take It""), leaving Tommy with just his family surrounding him. Tommy hears the voice of his ten-year-old self from the mirror (""See Me, Feel Me"") and for a moment, to the horror of his family, seems to be reverting to his old state. Instead, he turns to his family, whom he has ignored during his stardom, and embraces them in acceptance, before he climatically reunites with his younger selves onstage (""Listening to You/Finale"").","Young Captain Walker married in 1940. He soon left the young wife by going on a mission. During landing, the Englishman was captured and became a prisoner in the concentration camp. Pregnant Mrs. Walker was helped by Ernie, her husband's brother. Soon they received the message, saying that the captain was missing. In 1941, Mrs. Walker born the son Tommy. In 1945, all the concentration camp prisoners were released, but Walker wasn’t amongst them. Young woman celebrated her 21st birthday with a 4-years-old-son and her lover. Then the boy was sent to bed. Suddenly, the captain returned home. Soon he started a fight with a cohabitant of his wife. Tommy woke up and walked into the room. Mother turned him away from the fighting men, but the boy has seen everything in the large mirror. When Mrs. Walker tried to stop the fight, the captain shot his opponent. The husband and wife realized – their son witnessed the murder. The couple started to convince looking in the mirror Tommy that he had not seen or heard anything. He was forbidden to tell anyone about what happened.  When in the court they tried to get a testimony from the boy, the child did not tell anything. Captain justified himself saying he acted in self-defense. Soon parents realized – because of them, Tommy ceased to hear, see and speak. When he was taken for medical treatment, the doctors could not do anything with a boy. One day, the couple had to leave the house. Captain and Mrs. Walker left the 10-year-old son on the care of Uncle Ernie. The man took advantage of the helplessness of the child and abused him. Later cousin Kevin began to watch after Tommy. Making abuse of him first, he took a boy with him to the club. Kevin left Tommy near the pinball machine, paying one game and left to play billiards. Suddenly, the boy reacted to the game. By controlling the machine by touch, he scored a huge amount of points. This attracted lots of people around, among whom were the parents of the kid.  When Tommy again was showed to the doctor, he did not notice the changes in him. Soon the captain was offered to take a son to the gypsy woman, who supposedly could bring the boy to life. Walker did not dare to leave the child alone with this woman, and went back home with him. 10 years later, Tommy became a famous player in the pinball. He earned a lot of fans. The new treatment did not help the young man. One day, the mother couldn’t endure like this anymore and broke a mirror in front of which stood her son. At this point, the young man recalled the memory about the murder, and he once again started to perceive the world around. Soon Tommy left home. Fans embraced his recovery as a miracle happened thanks to a pinball game. Many newspapers have written about the miraculous recovery of a kid.  After a while, the cult of worship formed around Tommy. Kevin and his friends began to work in a young man's bodyguard service. Tommy wore a helmet, insulating senses from the outside world, and played pinball again. The young man was collecting stadiums of fans who wanted to become the same as he was. A fan Sally once had broken through the bodyguards circle to put a scarf on her idol. When bodyguards started beating her, Tommy stopped them. Taking her into his arms, the young man went to the house of the girl to her parents and invited everyone there. Mrs. Walker took injured Sally to the bedroom because their home was crowded with fans of Tommy. When they asked the young man how to become like him, he replied that they should not do so – everyone should be themselves. Disappointed with their idol, fans left him alone with Sally. Tommy had forgiven his relatives and restored relationship with them."
Be More Chill,"  Act One Jeremy Heere, a high school junior, is a social outcast. He lives with his recently divorced father, who works from home and makes Jeremy uncomfortable by refusing to wear pants in the house. At school, Jeremy is bullied by popular student Rich Goranski, who writes ""boyf"" on his backpack. His best friend, Michael Mell, (on whose backpack Rich has written ""riends"") tries to comfort Jeremy by telling him that being a loser is okay. Jeremy's long-time crush Christine Canigula signs up for the school play, and he decides to as well. Jeremy wonders if someone can help him ""more than survive"" (""More Than Survive"").As they wait for the first play rehearsal to begin, Christine professes her love of theater to Jeremy, because she can play different people and always knows what to say and do (""I Love Play Rehearsal""). The drama teacher, Mr. Reyes, reveals that the school play will be A Midsummer Night's Dream set in a post-apocalyptic future, re-titled A Midsummer Nightmare (About Zombies). During rehearsal, Jake Dillinger, one of the popular boys and Rich's friend, flirts with Christine, making Jeremy jealous (""More Than Survive (Reprise)""). Jeremy is confronted in the bathroom by Rich, who tells Jeremy how he managed his rise to popularity: as an unpopular freshman, he took a pill called a ""super quantum unit Intel processor""—a ""SQUIP""—containing a computer that implants itself inside the user's brain and tells the user what to do and say. Rich suggests that Jeremy buy one in order to become cooler (""The Squip Song"").While playing video games with Michael, Jeremy tells him about Rich's offer. After an awkward conversation with his dad (still not wearing pants), Jeremy decides to check the SQUIP out. Jeremy assures Michael that, no matter what happens, they'll always be a team (""Two-Player Game"").The two visit the mall to buy the SQUIP from a dealer at Payless ShoeSource. Jeremy, as instructed, swallows it with green Mountain Dew. When the SQUIP activates, it causes Jeremy to have a seizure in front of Christine and Jake (""The Squip Enters""). The SQUIP (in the guise of Keanu Reeves), criticizes Jeremy's appearance, personality, and behavior, telling him that everything about him is terrible (""Be More Chill, Pt. 1""). The SQUIP orders him to go to a store to buy a new Eminem shirt. Jeremy encounters two popular girls from school, Brooke Lohst and Chloe Valentine, and the SQUIP helps Jeremy fabricate a story in order to create empathy with the two girls. They offer Jeremy a ride home (""Do You Wanna Ride?"") which the SQUIP demands he accept, but Jeremy declines because he does not wish to leave Michael. The girls leave, and the SQUIP lies to Jeremy and tells him that Michael has left the mall. It tells him that in order for its plan to improve his social standing to work, Jeremy needs to obey every order it gives him (""Be More Chill, Pt. 2"").The next day, Jeremy heads to school with renewed confidence, wondering if he might be less invisible than before. The SQUIP delves into the inner psyche of the student body around him, giving Jeremy insight on the fears and insecurities of his fellow peers. Jeremy's SQUIP syncs itself with Rich's, instantly making them friends. Jeremy heads confidently to the play rehearsal (""Sync Up""). Christine tells Jeremy about her feelings for a guy she knows, who Jeremy initially believes is himself, but who turns out to be Jake (""A Guy That I'd Kinda Be Into""). Afterward, the SQUIP informs Jeremy that Christine won't date him until his social standing drastically improves. Encouraging Jeremy to use an interested Brooke as a stepping stone to greater popularity, he hooks up with her, while Jake asks Christine to come to his house (""Upgrade""). Overwhelmed, Jeremy asks the SQUIP to shut itself off for a few minutes. Immediately, Jeremy sees Michael and is elated but Michael states that Jeremy has been ignoring him all day. The SQUIP explains that it was using ""optic nerve blocking"" to block Michael from Jeremy's vision and that in order to be more popular he has to ""upgrade to Jeremy 2.0."" Jeremy eventually decides he is tired of being a loser and turns on optic nerve blocking, leaving him alone with the SQUIP (""Loser Geek Whatever""). Act Two On Halloween, Jake hosts a large party that features alcohol and other shenanigans (""Halloween""). Christine arrives in a revealing princess costume, hoping to please Jake, but he brushes her aside to party. Jeremy arrives to meet Brooke, but Chloe, who is jealous of Brooke, tries to seduce Jeremy. Jeremy is uncomfortable and tries to get away, but the SQUIP forces him to remain in the situation as it escalates to Chloe making out with Jeremy (""Do You Wanna Hang?""). Chloe also has Jeremy drink alcohol, causing the SQUIP to malfunction, and then feigns having sex with him, angering Jake and breaking Brooke's heart.Fleeing from Jake and the girls, Jeremy runs into a bathroom, where he finds Michael, who has crashed the party. Michael tries to warn Jeremy of the dangers of the SQUIP, explaining that someone ended up in a mental hospital after they went crazy trying to get it out of their head. Jeremy accuses Michael of being jealous of his popularity and calls him a loser. Michael, devastated and angry, locks himself in the bathroom, where he has a panic attack and sensory overload as he mourns the loss of his best and only friend (""Michael in the Bathroom""). Jeremy talks to Christine without the SQUIP's help and he asks her out in a burst of confidence (""A Guy That I'd Kinda Be Into (Reprise)""). Christine, who has found herself in an existential crisis after breaking up with Jake, declines.Meanwhile, Rich goes around the party frantically asking people for Mountain Dew Red. Jeremy's SQUIP finally reactivates and reviews the events of the night, prompting Jeremy to leave the party immediately. Rich, alone and desperate, talks to his SQUIP and then sets the house on fire. The next morning, Jenna Rolan, the school gossip, informs everyone that Rich had burned down Jake's house at the end of the party, sending Rich to the hospital and causing Jake to break both of his legs jumping out of a window trying to escape. The news spreads throughout the school through text and tweeting (""The Smartphone Hour (Rich Set a Fire)"").At home, Jeremy is confronted by his father (still no pants), who brings up Jeremy's new personality and change in attitude. Jeremy reprimands his father for his behavior since the divorce, calling him a loser as well. Shaken by Jeremy's words, Mr. Heere realizes that something is very wrong and that he must take charge. He tracks down Michael and asks him to not give up on his friend. Michael agrees to help on the condition that he puts on some pants and becomes a better father too (""The Pants Song"").As the cast prepares for the play, Jeremy encounters Christine, who is shaken and upset about the fire. Jeremy is unhappy with the relationships he has damaged and angrily blames the SQUIP for his misfortune. The SQUIP instead blames it on ""human error"" and tells Jeremy he can improve the lives of the rest of the students, and eventually the whole world, by providing them all with SQUIPs. In Rich's locker, Jeremy finds a box full of SQUIPs, which Jeremy then pours into a beaker of Mountain Dew (""The Pitiful Children"").  Backstage during the play, Christine confronts Jeremy over his use of the SQUIP, causing him to doubt the plan. However, the SQUIP has already begun to take over others in the play. The SQUIP reveals its intention to sync the entire student body, and then the whole world. Jeremy comes to a realization: green Mountain Dew activates the SQUIP, while red Mountain Dew deactivates it. Michael reappears from the audience with a bottle of Mountain Dew Red which he gives to Jeremy after making him apologize for his actions, but a SQUIPed Jake dumps most of it out. Jeremy and Michael fight off the controlled students until the SQUIP reveals that Christine has been SQUIPed, and under its influence, she professes her love for Jeremy. Jeremy, however, realizes this is not what he had wanted and makes Christine drink the last of the red Mountain Dew: this causes a chain reaction that destroys the rest of the SQUIPS (""The Play"").Jeremy wakes up in the hospital, sharing a room with Rich, who proudly informs Jeremy that he's bisexual and ready to finally be who he really is. Michael visits Jeremy and the two reconcile, and Mr. Heere (now wearing pants) visits Jeremy as well, informing him that he'll be a better dad. Surrounded by his friends and family, Jeremy realizes that there will always be outside influences, but he needs to learn to make up his own mind instead. He asks Christine out again (for bowling alley performance art), and this time she accepts and kisses him. The SQUIP reveals itself to still be alive, weakly taunting Jeremy from inside his head, but Jeremy ignores it, happily proclaiming that ""of the voices in my head, the loudest one is mine"" (""Voices in My Head"").","Hearing voices is never a good thing, unless the voices are coming from your squip. No, not script --- squip. Google ""squip"" and you'll come up with a boring kill-the-space-aliens game and some information about a supercomputer the size of an aspirin, currently illegal to use. Swallow the computer and become cool. Get all the girls, or guys. Dress sharp. Learn to flirt and drive, and generally be more chill."
The Wiz,"  Prologue Sixteen-year-old Dorothy Gale lives with her Aunt Em, Uncle Henry, and dog, Toto, on their farm in Kansas. Though her work on the farm keeps her busy, she often gets distracted in her boredom with farm life, choosing instead to play with Toto and dream of someday seeing far-off lands. Aunt Em, however, has little patience for Dorothy's daydreaming, believing that dawdling is contrary to their way of life. After an argument, Aunt Em apologizes to Dorothy for an unintentionally hurtful remark. She explains that she only scolds because she wants Dorothy to be the best she can be, and fears that Dorothy will not be prepared for the responsibilities life will soon put upon her. Aunt Em  loves Dorothy dearly and hopes they will always be as close as they were when Dorothy was younger (""The Feeling We Once Had""). Act I When an approaching storm turns out to be a tornado, Dorothy takes shelter in the farmhouse as Aunt Em and Uncle Henry do so in the storm cellar. As the tornado hits the farm, the house, with Dorothy inside, is lifted into the air and carried away for miles, with the wind represented by dancers (""The Tornado"").  The house finally comes to rest with a bump in the middle of a field covered with flowers.  There Dorothy is met by the Munchkins, all of whom are dressed in blue, and Addaperle, the Good Witch of the North, who tells her that she is in the Land of Oz. Furthermore, her house has fallen on Evamean, the Wicked Witch of the East, and killed her, freeing the Munchkins from her evil powers. Dorothy, distressed and confused, wants only to return home. With her magic unable to take Dorothy beyond the country boundaries, Addaperle decides Dorothy's best chance for assistance is to follow the Yellow Brick Road to the Emerald City in the centre of Oz, to see the great and powerful Wizard of Oz, or ""The Wiz"" for short (""He's the Wizard""). She gives Dorothy the Witch of the East's silver slippers, and tells her not to take them off before she reaches home, for they hold a mysterious, but very powerful charm that will keep her safe.Dorothy sets off down the Yellow Brick Road, full of doubt and fear at what lies ahead (""Soon As I Get Home""). Stopping to rest by a cornfield, she is startled when a scarecrow hanging on a pole strikes up a conversation with her (""I Was Born on the Day Before Yesterday""). He tells her of his longing for brains so that he can be like other people, and she invites him to accompany her to see if the Wizard can help him. (""Ease On Down the Road #1"").The Yellow Brick Road leads them into a great forest where they discover a man made of tin, rusted solid. They oil his joints (""Slide Some Oil To Me"") and he tells them how, to prevent him from marrying a servant girl, the Wicked Witch of the East put a spell on his axe so that it began to cut off parts of his body. Each time it happened, a tinsmith replaced the missing part with one made of tin until he was entirely made of it. The one thing the tinsmith forgot was a heart, and the Tin Man has longed for one ever since. Dorothy and the Scarecrow invite him on their journey to see the Wizard with the hope that he may give him one (""Ease On Down the Road #2"").The trio continue following the Yellow Brick Road deeper into the forest, where they are attacked by a large lion (""I'm a Mean Ole Lion""). However, he is quickly revealed to be a coward hiding behind bravado as Dorothy stands up for her friends. When he learns where they are going, he apologizes and asks if he may accompany them to ask the Wizard for some courage. They agree and the trio becomes a quartet (""Ease On Down the Road #3""), but face a new danger when they are attacked by half-tiger, half-bear creatures called Kalidahs (""Kalidah Battle""). After a great fight and harrowing escape, they stop by the road to rest. The Lion is embarrassed by his cowardice in the battle, but is comforted by Dorothy's kind words (""Be a Lion"").Seeing a green glow in the distance, they continue their journey to the Emerald City, and wander into a field of poppies who blow opium dust on them. Not being made of flesh, the Scarecrow and Tin Man are unaffected, but Dorothy and the Lion begin to become disoriented and drowsy. Dorothy recalls that the Munchkins warned her of the dangerous poppies, and runs from the field as fast as she can with the Scarecrow and Tin Man behind her. The Lion is overcome by the dust and begins to hallucinate (""Lion's Dream""). He is dragged from the field and returned to his friends by the Field Mice who police the area.Marching up to the gates of the Emerald City, they are met by the Gatekeeper who insists they must all be fitted with a pair of green tinted glasses that are locked on to prevent their eyes from being blinded by the dazzling sights. They enter the city and look about in awe at the richly dressed people that inhabit it (""Emerald City Ballet""). The haughty and condescending people laugh and ridicule this odd party for wanting to see the Wizard until they see that Dorothy is wearing the Witch of the East's silver slippers. They are promptly shown right into his palace.Once in the throne room, they are assaulted by a great show of lights, smoke, and pyrotechnics as the Wizard appears in several forms before them (""So You Wanted To See the Wizard""). They each plead their case to him, the Tin Man doing so in song (""What Would I Do If I Could Feel?""). He agrees on one condition: they must kill Evillene, the Wicked Witch of the West. With their goals seeming further out of reach than ever before, Dorothy and her companions sink to the floor in tears. Act II Evillene rules over the yellow land of the west, enslaving its people, the Winkies. She is evil, power hungry, and ruthlessly determined to get her hands on the silver slippers, so that she may increase her power and rule over all of Oz (""Don't Nobody Bring Me No Bad News""). Receiving word of Dorothy and her friends approaching, she sends her Winged Monkeys to kill them (""Funky Monkeys""). Catching up to the group in the forest surrounding Evillene's castle, the monkeys dash the Tin Man against rocks until he falls apart, and rip the straw out of the Scarecrow, leaving both of them helpless. Seeing Dorothy's silver slippers, however, they dare not harm her. Instead, they carry her to Evillene's castle along with the Lion. While searching for a way to get the slippers from Dorothy, Evillene forces her and the Lion to do menial chores around her castle. She takes delight in torturing the Lion before Dorothy, threatening to have him skinned unless she hands over the silver slippers. Angered by this, she picks up a bucket of water and throws it over Evillene, who melts until only her magic golden cap remains. Her spell on the Winkies is lifted, and they show their thanks by restoring the Scarecrow and Tin Man to top condition, and reuniting the group (""Everybody Rejoice""/""Brand New Day"").Returning to the Emerald City, they see the Wizard (now a booming voice that seems to come from the very air). He reneges on his promise, and the Lion knocks over a screen in anger. Behind it stands a bewildered man who claims to be the real Wizard. He shows them the elaborate mechanical effects used to create his illusions, and tells them that he is really a balloonist from Omaha named Herman Smith who traveled to Oz by accident when his hot air balloon drifted off course. The people of Oz had never seen such a sight and proclaimed him Wizard. Not wanting to disappoint them, he assumed the role and had a great city built. He then had everyone in it wear green glasses, and in time, they came to believe it was green.Furious, the group confronts the Wizard on his deceptions (""Who Do You Think You Are?""), but he points out that the Scarecrow, Tin Man, and Lion already have the things they seek as shown in their behavior on the journeys they have made (""Believe In Yourself""). They remain unconvinced, so he creates physical symbols of their desires and they are satisfied. He proposes that Dorothy can return to Kansas the way he came, and offers to pilot her in his hot air balloon. He addresses the citizens of the Emerald City in person for the first time in many years, telling them of his imminent journey, and leaving the Scarecrow in charge (""Y'all Got It!""). Just as his speech reaches its climax, the balloon comes free from its moorings and rises quickly into the air, taking Dorothy's hopes of getting home with it.Just as the group despairs of finding help, Addaperle reappears in a flash of light, suggesting that Dorothy ask Glinda, the Good Witch of the South, for assistance. She transports them to Glinda's castle in the red land of the south, where they are warmly welcomed and invited to rest after their many trials (""A Rested Body Is a Rested Mind""). Glinda is a beautiful and gracious sorceress, surrounded by a court of pretty girls. She tells Dorothy that the silver slippers have always had the power to take her home, but like her friends, she needed to believe in their magic and in herself before it was possible (""If You Believe""). Dorothy bids a tearful goodbye to her friends, and as their faces fade into the darkness, she thinks about what she has gained, lost, and learned throughout her journey through Oz (""Home""). Clicking her heels together three times, she finds herself transported back to Kansas in an instant. As an overjoyed Aunt Em and Toto appear, and Dorothy runs to hug them, she knows that she is back home at last (""Finale"").","A girl used to live with her aunt & Uncle on a ranch in the small town on the USA. A girl dreamed of seeing distant lands. Aunt worried about a niece; she loved a girl & hoped that they would always be together.  The thunderstorm was approaching. Her relatives hid deep down in the basement of their habitat, but a girl was caught by a storm inside the living place. The thunderstorm rips off the structure & takes it far away from the farm, where a girl was hoping not to die. Tornado brought her on a meadow, right on Evamean, Bad virago. The latter was killed.  Caught in a strange site among flowers, a girl had met the Weal North Virago. As girl had inextricable desire to return from where she was, she had to visit the Wizard of this state – Wiz, according Weal North Virago. A girl had to ask this fellow about her return. Weal North Virago presented a girl argent footgear like a talisman. A girl hit the road. Stopping to rest on some field, she have met talking Jackstraw. It dreamt so Wiz gave it the possibility to reflect. Hitting the road at three, travelers meet the Cannikin Lumberman, who wished to receive the ticker. Altogether they’ve became acquainted with Pusillanimous Leo, which wanted to be audacious; large company continues their way.  Wanderers had to overcome a meadow of hop poppies. Plants hadn’t affect the Jackstraw & the Cannikin Lumberman, but the protagonist & the Pusillanimous Leo gatherer own strengths to stampede outta there in order not to fall asleep till the end of times.  Approaching the gates of the Emerald City, travelers wore special glasses to avoid being blinded by its light. The company went through the streets. Strangers were accompanied to the palace of Wiz.

Fun Home," summary As she works on her memoir in the present day, successful middle-aged cartoonist Alison Bechdel (Alison) recalls two time periods in her life. The first is her childhood, around age 10 (Small Alison), when she struggles against her father Bruce's obsessive demands and begins to identify her inchoate sexuality. The second is her first year in college (Medium Alison), when she begins her first relationship and comes out of the closet as a lesbian.Alison remembers herself, as a child, demanding that her father Bruce play ""airplane"" with her, while he sorts through a box of junk and valuables he has salvaged from a barn (""It All Comes Back""). Bruce tells the family that a visitor from the local historical society is coming to see their ornate Victorian home that he has restored, and his wife Helen prepares the house to Bruce's demanding aesthetic standard (""Welcome to Our House on Maple Avenue""). In a phone call with her father and a journal entry, Medium Alison expresses her anxiety about starting college (""Not Too Bad""). At the Bechdel Funeral Home, Small Alison and her brothers John and Christian perform an imaginary advertisement for the funeral home (""Come to the Fun Home""). Medium Alison hesitates outside the door of the college's Gay Union, and is flummoxed when she meets Joan, a confident young lesbian. Bruce invites Roy, a young man whom he has hired to do yard work, into the house. Bruce begins to seduce Roy in the library while Helen is playing the piano upstairs, trying her best to ignore it (""Helen's Etude"").Medium Alison writes a letter to her parents about college life but does not mention Joan or her recent realization that she is a lesbian. Bruce orders Small Alison to put on a dress, but she would rather wear jeans. Bruce tells her that the other children would laugh at her; she reluctantly obeys him (""Party Dress""). Medium Alison proudly tells Joan that she has written a letter to her parents telling them that she is a lesbian, but begins to second-guess herself until Joan kisses her. That night, she is delirious with joy after having had sex with Joan and finally discovering her sexuality (""Changing My Major"").Alison considers the connection between her coming out and her father's death. Small Alison has a homework assignment to draw a map of places her family has been to, but Bruce aggressively takes over, drawing it the way he thinks it should look. Alison realizes that despite having traveled widely, her father's place of birth, life, work and death can all be placed in a small circle in Beech Creek, Pennsylvania (""Maps""). Bruce offers a ride and a beer to an underage boy, and it is later implied that they had a sexual encounter. Medium Alison writes to her parents, asking for a response to her coming-out letter. Small Alison watches The Partridge Family, but Bruce angrily switches it off. Small Alison talks to him, and finds out that he is going to see a psychiatrist, but he is ambiguous about the reason. Alison expresses annoyance that he lied to her; the reason he was going was because he was arrested for what he did to the underage boy. Helen attempts to reassure Small Alison that the psychiatrist will help her father, but she too refuses to elaborate. Bruce starts a vicious argument with Helen and breaks several of her possessions along with some library books. Small Alison fantasizes about her family as the happy family singing together on television (""Raincoat of Love"").Alison remembers a time when Bruce took her and her brothers on a trip to New York City. After a long day, Small Alison, Christian and John settle into sleeping bags. Small Alison wakes up and catches Bruce sneaking out. Bruce sings her a lullaby (""Pony Girl""). He reassures his daughter that he's just going out for a paper, but Alison realizes he was probably going cruising. Medium Alison is angered by a noncommittal letter from Bruce responding to her coming out. At a luncheonette with her father, Small Alison notices a butch delivery woman and feels an inexplicable kinship with her (""Ring of Keys"").Medium Alison calls home to demand a better response from her parents and is astonished when her mother reveals that her father has had sexual relationships with men and boys. Alison explores the tensions her family was under at this time and watches a heated argument between her parents. Medium Alison returns home for vacation with Joan. Helen confesses to Medium Alison her troubled and turbulent life with Bruce (""Days and Days""). Medium Alison, Joan and Bruce have an unexpectedly pleasant evening around the piano. Bruce asks Alison if she'd like to go for a drive, and (adult) Alison realizes that Medium Alison is gone; she joins her father in the car, breaking the boundaries of time. On the drive, she and Bruce struggle to express themselves to each other (""Telephone Wire"").Bruce, manically engaged in a new restoration project, tries and fails to find a way to hold his life together. He steps in front of a truck and is killed (""Edges of the World""). Alison, newly reconciled to her past, remembers and draws a moment of perfect balance: playing ""airplane"" with her father, while reminiscing about the past with the other Alisons (""Flying Away"").","Intricate plot, in which several storylines are interwoven that are created by the same people, only at different times of their life and age.  In the first age is 10-years-old teenager, a girl who is just beginning to be aware of personal oomph, and she had no one to share it, because her father is busy in some second-hand artifacts out of the barn of his neighbor.

There she met with one of the active lesbians and understands that her own focus is the same. She receives the first experience of one-gender copulation with that girl. She writes a letter to the parents, telling that she now has changed her orientation. After the letter was read by her father, he suddenly died and now she blames herself for his death, because she sees a direct causal link between writing and death.  In the story – a while later, but in real time – some time before, already grown-up girl comes to visit parents with her college friend and mother tells her that a marriage with dad turned into nothingness for her, a waste of time and she never had a chance to realize own ambitions. Boundaries of time gradually blurred and we see a woman in the middle age fades out and is incorporated with an adult her as she rides in a car with her alive father. Now a grown woman, she as was divided into 3 parts and remembers what a good time she had with all her three hypostasis, young, middle, and an adult; as they played with their father in running airplanes. Her father entered the roadway under the wheels of the truck flying at him, because he could not find peace with himself."

He admits the truth to Brenda, telling her his real name: Frank William Abagnale Jr. He promises to return after escaping from Hanratty. Just as he leaves, Hanratty enters, asking Brenda where Frank went. She laments that she loves Frank and would never tell on him (""Fly, Fly Away""), but is tricked into doing so shortly thereafter.The story returns to the opening scene, where Frank is cornered in the airport.

Frank – the name of a hero, who put half of FBI of that time on the legs. His parents met during WWII. They did not have enough money, so he didn’t go to a private school, but he had a jacket from there and he has worn it for a regular school.

Someday, a principal found him teaching French in the absence of the teacher in the classroom and told his parents. Soon, his parents separated because of the romance of his mother, and he has learned a large portion of self-reliance and also have learned how to falsify checks and to cash them in various banks across the USA, to deceit a banking system for millions of dollars.  In New York, he met the flight attendants and wanted to become a pilot. Pan American had a vacancy of co-pilot and he falsified all the necessary documents, being accepted for this position.

Then he goes to his parents, including Frank’s mother and her new husband.  After Frank got bored to be a pilot, he somehow gets to the party of doctors. There he meets one of them, who offers Frank work in his hospital. Now Frank is surrounded by beautiful and very caring nurses that are ready to take the Doctor's Orders. He falls in love for one of the nurses, Brenda, who at first thinks he's intimidating, but then submits to his charms, and when he asks for her hand, she agrees.

Before the wedding, Frank learns that the FBI agent already on his tail and runs away from the nuptials. A bride does not give up his whereabouts or where he had moved, but after some time, she opens to FBI.

Sweet Charity,"  Act I The young woman Charity Hope Valentine is a taxi dancer at a dance hall called the Fandango Ballroom in New York City. With a shoulder bag and a heart tattooed on her left shoulder, Charity meets her boyfriend Charlie in Central Park. While Charlie silently preens himself, Charity speaks the pick-up lines she imagines him saying, and tells him how handsome he is (""You Should See Yourself""). Charlie then steals her handbag and pushes her into the lake (usually the orchestra pit) before running off. Passers-by discuss the apparent drowning but do nothing, until a young Spaniard finally rescues her. In the Hostess Room of the Fandango Ballroom, Charity tries to convince both herself and the other skeptical taxi dancers that Charlie tried to save her. Nickie, a fellow dancer, tells Charity that her problem is ""you run your heart like a hotel — you've always got people checking in and checking out"".

Ursula refuses to go back inside with Vittorio, who promptly takes the only-too-willing Charity instead. Inside the Pompeii Club, the dancers are dancing the latest craze, The Rich Man's Frug. To everyone's astonishment, the famous Vittorio is accompanied by the unknown Charity. She tries to steer him away from the subject of Ursula. Finally, he wants to dance. Not having eaten since breakfast, Charity faints. There is general agreement amongst the dancers that she needs to be ""laid down"". Vittorio asks ""where?"", and Charity recovers enough to prompt Vittorio with ""your apartment!"".Lying down on Vittorio's bed, Charity claims she is no longer hungry. She admits she is a dance hall hostess, putting it down to ""the fickle finger of fate"" (a favorite expression of hers). Vittorio is struck by her humor and honesty. Starstruck, Charity asks for a signed photograph to prove to the girls she was really in his apartment. While Vittorio fetches props from his old movies for further evidence, Charity remarks on her good fortune (""If My Friends Could See Me Now""). Ursula arrives to apologize for her jealousy; Charity is swiftly bundled into a closet before Vittorio opens the door to Ursula.

The following morning, Charity is escorted from the room by a mortified Vittorio. In the Hostess Room, the girls are disappointed that Charity failed to get more out of Vittorio. Nickie announces she is not going to remain at this job for the rest of her life, prompting the girls to speculate on alternative careers (""There's Gotta Be Something Better Than This""), but Herman brings them back down to earth. Charity decides to seek some cultural enlightenment at the 92nd Street Y, where she gets stuck in a broken elevator with shy tax accountant Oscar Lindquist. While trying to calm him down, Charity learns that he is not married. She declares, ""Oh Oscar... You're gonna be all right.""

Act II After being trapped in a broken elevator, Oscar and Charity are finally rescued when it starts working again. Oscar invites Charity to go to church with him, to which she hesitantly agrees. As they walk under the Manhattan Bridge to the church, the faint cries of the next person to be stuck in the elevator are heard. The Rhythm of Life Church turns out to be a thin veneer on hippie culture (""The Rhythm of Life""). A police raid breaks up the meeting. Traveling home on the subway, Oscar proposes another date and tries to guess Charity's job, deciding that she works in a bank. Charity lies, saying she works for First National City, Williamsburg Branch. As they part, Oscar kisses her hand, and dubs her Sweet Charity (""Sweet Charity"").After two weeks, Oscar and Charity have continued dating, and she still has not confessed what she actually does for a living. At Coney Island Amusement Park they become trapped again when the Parachute Jump ride breaks. This time, Oscar is the calm one while Charity is scared — scared that she is starting to depend on him. Once again, Charity loses her nerve about telling him what her real job is. As the crowd looks on, the couple kisses. On a slow night at the Fandango, Charity loses the opportunity to snare one of the few customers to a new co-worker, Rosie. Disgusted by the whole business, she quits. However, in Times Square, she wonders what the alternative is (""Where Am I Going?""). Sending a telegram to Oscar, she asks to meet him at Barney's Chile Hacienda.

Soon a dancer had witnessed the quarrel between the film star Vittorio and his girlfriend Ursula. The woman left her lover, refusing to return to the club.

Woman woke up already in the apartment of Vittorio. The dancer said that she was not hungry, and told the actor of the place of her work. The man liked the honesty and humor of his new friend. When a girl asked from him an autograph on photo for memory, Vittorio agreed. When the actor was looking for a picture, Ursula came to him, to apologize for her behavior. Charity sat up till the morning in the closet, and then a man secretly released her from the apartment.  When her friends found out about this meeting, they were disappointed by the fact that a woman was not able to get acquainted with Vittorio closer. Soon the dancers began to discuss their future – none of them was going to be a lifetime partner on call. Charity began to think about her fate seriously. The woman went to the community center to find out whether there was a decent job for her. Dancer stuck in an elevator with a shy accountant Oscar. When he started to have a claustrophobic seizure, Charity helped him. She learned that the man was a bachelor. Oscar was able to hold on until the elevator had been launched.

Charity was also worrying about the lie that she had said earlier. After appearance of a new girl-dancer in the new Fandango Ballroom, visitors stopped inviting her. A woman decided to leave work. Soon she sent an accountant a telegram asking him for a new meeting. When Charity told him about her profession, it became clear that Oscar was already aware of this – he could not resist and followed the dancer to the hall. Accountant suggested the woman to marry him. Soon happy Charity started to gather her belongings. After the farewell party, she left the Fandango Ballroom with Oscar. When the couple came to the park, an accountant unexpectedly announced that he could not forget those men with whom Charity met earlier. Oscar broke off their engagement and pushed the woman into the lake. After ex-fiancé escaped, dancer climbed ashore herself. Charity could be consoled only by the fact that this time her purse was left with her."
Mame," The madcap life of eccentric Mame Dennis and her bohemian, intellectual arty clique is disrupted when her deceased brother's 10-year-old son Patrick is entrusted to her care. Rather than bow to convention, Mame introduces the boy to her free-wheeling lifestyle, instilling in him her favorite credo, ""Life is a banquet, and most poor sons-of-bitches are starving to death."" Figuring in the storyline are Agnes Gooch (Mame's personal secretary and nanny-in-law), Vera Charles (her ""bosom buddy"" baritone actress and world's greatest lush) and Dwight Babcock (the stuffy and officious executor of her brother's estate). Mame loses her fortune in the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and tries her hand at a number of jobs with comically disastrous results but perseveres with good humor and an irrepressible sense of style.Mame then meets and marries Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside, a Southern aristocrat with a Georgia plantation called Peckerwood. The trustees of Patrick's father force Mame to send Patrick off to boarding school (the fictional St Boniface, in Massachusetts), and Mame and Beau travel the world on an endless honeymoon that stops when Beau falls to his death while mountain climbing. Mame returns home a wealthy widow to discover that Patrick has become a snob engaged to an equally priggish debutante, Gloria Upson, from a bigoted family. Mame brings Patrick to his senses just in time to introduce him to the woman who will eventually become his wife, Pegeen Ryan. As the story ends, Mame is preparing to take Patrick's young son, Peter, to India with her usual flair.","Mame Dennis is in the center of the story – socialite, accustomed to luxury and other delights of bohemian life. Her whole story as if taken from the expensive Hollywood film. But once happens what the heroine obviously could not foresee. After the death of a cousin, his son Patrick aged 10 goes into the care of Aunt Mame. She doesn’t want to bring up a nephew in severity, and gives more freedom to little fellow, showing all the charm of really big wealth. She instills Patrick her beloved creed. It sounds something like this: life is a banquet & poorest mongrels die of hunger. Auntie says a nephew that he’ll understand the abovementioned later, at a time when he learns his true vocation.  In addition to these two people, the musical contains several other interesting characters. Among them the personal secretary of the socialite Agnes, part-time nanny-in-law; actress Vera, with a unique baritone – the best friend of Mame; Dwight – bailiff, who deals with the question of the property inheritance of father of Patrick. Suddenly, the main character faces the tragedy: during the Wall Street’s crash, she loses all her fortune. Mame is trying to get different kinds of job, but fail all the time. Despite this, a woman is in a good mood and always retains a refined sense of style.  After some time, the main character meets a representative aristocrat with a long sonorous name Beauregard Jackson Pickett Burnside. With characteristic lightheadedness, Mame marries this gentleman. It is difficult to judge about love (which isn’t here), but the plantations in Georgia worth millions of dollars definitely played a role. The trustees of the deceases brother of the woman require to take Patrick away from St. Boniface boarding school. Mame with Beauregard went on a long journey around the world. One day, when climbing a high mountain, tragedy happens – husband of the heroine brakes down and dies. She has returned home as a wealthy widow, whose opulence is estimated in number of seven-digits. Much to own disappointment, Mame discovers for herself complete change of Patrick. Now he is more like a pedantic snob who cares after a priggish girl named Gloria. Unable to undertake this, aunt quickly leads her nephew to feelings. The woman reminds him of all the things she had taught him as a child. Later she introduces Patrick with an attractive woman – his future wife Pegeen. The final scene of the musical shows the audience a little bit aged Mame, which is preparing to meet her grandson Peter. Who else but the main character is to teach the little boy the basics of a beautiful life?"
Seven Brides for Seven Brothers," In 1850, backwoodsman Adam Pontipee comes to town in the Oregon Territory to shop and look for a bride. He eventually comes upon the local tavern, where he sees Milly chopping wood. After being convinced of her worth by the quality of her cooking and her insistence on finishing her chores before she would leave with him, he proposes and she accepts despite knowing him for only a few hours.On the journey home, Milly talks about how she is excited to be cooking and taking care of only one man while Adam begins to look uncomfortable. When they arrive at his cabin in the mountains, Milly is surprised to learn that Adam is the eldest of seven brothers living under the same roof. The brothers have been given Bible names alphabetically: Adam, Benjamin, Caleb, Daniel, Ephraim, Frank (short for frankincense—supposedly due to no Bible names beginning with F—and their mother thought he smelled sweet), and Gideon. All of the brothers have red hair, and all but Gideon are well over six feet tall. Milly is also shocked at how dirty their house is, along with how unkempt and uncouth Adam and his brothers are. Later that night, Milly is angry and tells Adam that he wanted a servant girl instead of a wife. Adam acknowledges he needed her to be able to work because living in the backwoods is a hard life. After he plans to spend the night sleeping in a tree outside their window so that he won't lose face with his brothers, she relents after explaining she was upset because she had had high hopes of marriage and love. The next morning, Milly decides to teach Adam and his brothers cleanliness and proper manners - especially at the table during meals. After the brothers wash and shave, Milly is shocked at how handsome they are, and that none of them got married. It turns out that the brothers rarely saw girls and never learned how to communicate with them. At first, the brothers have a hard time changing from their ""mountain man"" ways, but eventually come to see their only chance to get brides of their own is to do things Milly's way. They try out their new manners at a social gathering in the town (a dance and barn-raising), where they meet six women they like – Dorcas, Ruth, Martha, Liza, Sarah, and Alice. The girls take a fancy to the brothers as well. However, all of them already have suitors among the young men of the town, who taunt the brothers into fighting during the barn-raising. At first, the six brothers remember Milly's teachings and try to resist being drawn into a fight. The suitors finally go too far when they attack Adam, provoking Gideon into fighting back. A brawl ensues in which the brothers dominate their physically weaker town rivals. Although the Pontipee brothers did not start the fight, they are kicked out of the town by the townspeople.Winter comes, and the six younger brothers are pining for the girls they had fallen in love with. Milly asks Adam to talk to the brothers as she fears they will want to leave because of missing the girls. Adam reads his brothers the story of ""The Sobbin' Women"" (taken from Plutarch's story of the Sabine Women), from the book of Stories from Plutarch that Milly had brought to the homestead along with her Bible. He tells them that they should take whatever action is necessary to get their women.Aided by Adam, the brothers kidnap the six girls, then cause an avalanche in Echo Pass so the townspeople can't pursue them. The Pontipee homestead is cut off from the town until the spring thaw opens Echo Pass again. The only problem: the brothers forgot to bring the parson along to perform the marriages. Milly is furious with Adam and his brothers for kidnapping the women, and she kicks Adam and his brothers out of their house and sends them to the barn to ""eat and sleep with the rest of the livestock,"" while the women stay in the house with her. Adam, angered by Milly's action, leaves for the trapping cabin further up the mountain to spend the winter by himself. Gideon tells Milly and begs her to tell Adam not to leave, but Milly refuses, saying: ""He's gotta learn that he can't treat people this way.""Winter slowly passes, and the women vent their frustrations by pulling pranks on the brothers, though there is clear attraction on both sides. After Milly announces that she's going to have a baby, the women and the brothers come together as a family. Milly gives birth to a daughter, in the spring. The daughter is named Hannah as a continuum to the names in alphabetical order, the last one being Gideon. Gideon rides to the cabin to inform Adam of his daughter's arrival and asks him to come home. Adam refuses, saying that he had said he would return home when the pass was open.Adam does return home, when Echo Pass comes open, to reconcile with Milly and meet his new daughter. As a newly responsible father, he has become aware of how worried the townspeople would be about what has happened to the six abducted girls. Adam admits that he would have hung his daughter's kidnapper(s) on the nearest tree; Milly forgives him for his past behavior.Adam tells his brothers they need to return the women to their families; the brothers are unwilling, believing their parents won't let them marry their daughters, and the other six women refuse to return to their families, lest their parents to force them to return to their former suitors;  they run away to hide.  When Milly discovers that they are not in the house, Adam tells the brothers to find them and bring them back.The townspeople arrive, intent on hanging the Pontipee brothers for the kidnappings. The fathers, who find the brothers trying to force the women to return to town, misunderstand their efforts as assault, and charge to the girls' rescue.Alice's father, Reverend Elcott (Ian Wolfe) -- the minister the brothers had forgotten to grab when they took the girls—hears baby Hannah cry in the distance, and worries that the baby might belong to one of the kidnapped girls. Elcott asks the girls whose baby he heard, and to not be afraid to tell. They each answer ""Mine."" This misinformation serves the women's and the brothers' needs: the townspeople, including the girls' fathers, insist on immediate  shotgun weddings, which are performed by Reverend Elcott, while Adam and Milly watch and the fathers stand behind their respective daughters' grooms, guns over their arms. The film ends with the brothers kissing their respective brides in the living room of the Pontipee cabin.","Actions of musical carry spectators in 1850, in the State of Oregon.

Sister Act,"  West End Act 1In Philadelphia, Mother Superior declares that the convent is in need (Prologue) before Deloris Van Cartier, crowned 'Lady Fabulous' of 1978, is seen performing in the night club run by her gangster boyfriend Curtis Shank (""Take Me to Heaven""). Deloris is overjoyed as she believes her boyfriend is going to introduce her to a record producer on that day (her birthday), although she soon learns that this is not to be. Hurt and frustrated, Deloris goes to her backup singers KT and LaRosa, about her dreams of stardom and fame (""Fabulous, Baby!""). She decides to break up with Shank and head out of Philadelphia to go fulfill her dreams on her own. However she gets to Shank just in time to see him and his crew made up of nephew TJ, Bones, and Dinero, shoot someone who they believe has ""squealed"" about them to the cops. Horrified, Deloris runs away and Shank orders his men to get her and bring her back. Deloris runs to a police station and tells the desk chief, Eddie, about what happened. The two recognize each other as old friends from school with Deloris calling him ""Sweaty Eddie"". Eddie decides that Deloris needs to go into the witness protection  program and sends her to the place he believes Shank will never find her - a convent called The Holy Order of the Little Sisters of Our Mother of Perpetual Faith.Deloris is disappointed by this idea as she learns from the Mother Superior that contact with the outside world is limited, and that she cannot smoke, drink, or wear any of her less than appropriate clothing (""Here Within These Walls""). Deloris joins the other nuns for dinner and after several comedic interactions with the overly perky Sister Mary Patrick, Deloris discovers how the other nuns got their ""calling"" from the Lord (""How I Got the Calling""). They then ask Deloris to share her story with them and she lies.Meanwhile, back in his nightclub, Shank is frustrated that he cannot find Deloris anywhere. He tells his goons how he will not stop until he finds and kills Deloris (""When I Find My Baby""). Back at the convent Deloris is bored by the simple life of the nuns and decides to hit the town. She goes across the street to a slinky bar, and is followed by Sister Mary Lazarus, Sister Mary Patrick, and Sister Mary Robert. When the three nuns arrive they are shocked to find Sister Mary Clarence (Deloris' undercover name) drinking and dancing, however they assume that she is attempting to save the lost souls in the bar. Deloris goes along with this idea and gets the whole bar dancing (""Do the Sacred Mass""). However, the joyful mood is quickly destroyed when Deloris recognises Shank's boys entering the bar. She tries to hide herself as they ask people in the bar if they've seen Deloris. Suddenly there is a fight in the bar which has to be broken up by Eddie and the Mother Superior, who orders the nuns to go back to the convent. She then confronts Deloris telling her that she must conform to the life of the nuns.  Eddie agrees, telling Deloris that Shank has upped the price on her head, so she needs to be careful. Deloris storms back to the convent after being informed that she has to wake up at 5 a.m. and join the choir. Eddie, now alone with only the drunks and homeless on the street, sings of his desire to be cool, to let go, and impress Deloris (""I Could Be That Guy"").The following morning Deloris attends the choir practice and loudly admits that the choir sounds terrible. This prompts the Mother Superior to let Deloris lead the choir. Deloris does so and teaches the nuns how to sing in key and on time. She also manages to break the quiet and timid Sister Mary Robert out of her shell (""Raise Your Voice""). That Sunday, the choir perform an up-tempo hymn (""Take Me to Heaven (Reprise)"") which to the struggling church's surprise brings in more people and more donations. The Mother Superior, however, is horrified how the simple traditional choir she knew has changed and become modern.  The news of the choir soon spreads with photographers and news reporters coming in to get the story behind the latest sensation - this wonderful nontraditional choir.Act 2Over the coming weeks, the choir has become incredibly successful and the money from donations has paid for the church to be remodelled and fixed (""Sunday Morning Fever""). However, the newfound fame comes at a price. Shank and his goons spot Deloris with the choir in the newspaper. Shank orders his boys to get into the convent and bring Deloris to him. TJ, Bones, and Dinero discuss how they will do this (""Lady in the Long Black Dress""). Meanwhile, back at the church, Monsignor Howard has some terrific news: the choir has been asked to perform a special concert in front of the Pope. The choir are overjoyed but nervous and that night they ask Deloris to pray for their success (""Bless Our Show""). Deloris is also looking forward to the occasion, although the Mother Superior calls her over and tells her that Shank's men have just come looking for her and she must leave quickly. The other nuns overhear and Deloris is forced to tell them the truth about who she really is and that she cannot perform with them. Deloris quickly runs off to get her things followed by Sister Mary Robert while the other nuns disappointedly go back to their rooms. Alone in Deloris' room, the Mother Superior expresses joy that life can go back to being as it was. However it is evident that she, along with the other nuns, have developed a love for Sister Mary Clarence and her modern if somewhat unorthodox ways (""Here Within These Walls (Reprise)"").As Deloris prepares to leave Sister Mary Robert begs to come with her, claiming that she has been inspired to become a stronger person and go after the things she wants (""The Life I Never Led""). Deloris tells her that she doesn't need her to do that, and that she can do it all herself if she really wants to. Deloris runs from the convent and stays at Eddie's house for the night. While there she initially is overjoyed that the following day she will testify against Shank and his boys and then go back to pursuing the career she's dreamed of (""Fabulous, Baby! (Reprise)""). Guilty for abandoning her sisters when they needed her, she reflects on her life and realises that the choices she is making will leave her with nothing but fame and money, and when the lights go out she will be alone. She decides to return to the convent and sing with her sisters (""Sister Act"").Meanwhile, Shank thinks up a new way to get into the convent (""When I Find My Baby (Reprise)""). Dressed as nuns, Shank and his boys sneak into the convent; they find and chase Deloris. Sister Mary Patrick, who has seen what has happened, informs the other nuns who insist they must go and help Deloris. The Mother Superior, however, is adamant that they stay and call the police, prompting an outburst from Sister Mary Robert who tells her that she won't be quiet and take orders blindly anymore; that she is going to help Deloris (""The Life I Never Led (Reprise)""). The other nuns agree and all of them go running through the convent looking for Deloris. It all comes down to a final confrontation in which Shank, armed and dangerous, tells Deloris to get on her knees and beg for her life. However, all the sisters and nuns stand in front of her telling Shank that they will have to go through them first (""Sister Act (Reprise)""). Shank is about to start firing at the nuns when Eddie comes in and fights Shank off. He arrests Shank and his boys and then asks Deloris out on a date which she accepts. Mother Superior and Deloris come to a truce and accept that perhaps they are not so different after all. The show ends with all the nuns and eventually the entire cast performing for the Pope (""Spread the Love Around""). Broadway Act 1On Christmas Eve, Deloris Van Cartier is performing for her gangster boyfriend Curtis Jackson in the night club he owns (""Take Me to Heaven""). Deloris is overjoyed as she believes her boyfriend is going to introduce her to a record producer on that day, although she soon learns that this is not to be. Jackson tells her he cannot join her for Christmas Day, but gives her a coat, which she discovers belonged to his wife. Hurt and frustrated, Deloris goes to her backup singers Michelle and Tina, about her dreams of stardom and fame (""Fabulous, Baby!""). She decides to break up with Jackson and head out of Philadelphia to go fulfill her dreams on her own. However she gets to Jackson just in time to see him and his crew - made up of daft and childlike nephew TJ, suave second-in-command Joey, and Spanish speaking Pablo - shoot one of his members who they believe has ""squealed"" about them to the cops.Horrified, Deloris runs away and Jackson orders his men to get her and bring her back. Deloris runs to a police station and tells the desk chief, Eddie, about what happened. The two recognize each other as old friends from school with Deloris calling him ""Sweaty Eddie"".

He tells Joey, TJ, and Pablo how he will not stop until he finds and kills Deloris (""When I Find My Baby""). Back at the convent Deloris is hungry from the fast.

Deloris offers to try teaching them, taking over from Sister Mary Lazarus, an older and crankier nun with a love for rapping. Deloris teaches the nuns how to sing in key and in time. She also manages to break the quiet and timid Sister Mary Robert out of her shell (""Raise Your Voice"").

They are: moody middle-aged salesman Ladislav, young deliveryman Arpad, the shy assistant manager Georg, and thirty-year Ilona, having a certain connection with the suave Steven.  Mr. Maraczek arrives at the grand opening of the store, which by that time has collected a lot of interested people. Parallel to this, Georg is exchanging letters with an anonymous woman known to him by a secret name Dear Friend.

He was sympathetic to what was happening, and in a joking manner advised his manager to forget about the bachelor life.  In just a few months, the shop stood on its feet, significantly increased sales. Much of this was due to the arrival of new worker – good-looking Amalia. The young girl immediately struck Maraczek by her ability to sell items. After some time, the owner of the perfume store proposed her the position of leading consultant.  Winter came, and the relationships between workers have strongly shaken. It all started with a public quarrel of Ilona and Kodaly, which ended in rupture of relations between them.

To make her partner recognize her, she is holding a copy of the book Anna Karenina and a beautiful rose. Not having time to get on a date, Georg asks Sipos to pass to a stranger his letter explaining the reasons of his absence.  Further events are developing with an incredibly high speed. Gossips, intrigues, secret relationship, general suspicions and even attempt of suicide of Mr. Maraczek – all this takes place within walls of a small perfumery. It is difficult to find in these events at least something good, but they contributed to reconciliation of the protagonists, to resolve the conflict existing amongst the employees. This also applies to Amalia with Georg, who long after found out the fact that they were related in correspondence and finally get to the rendezvous. Men and women have realized that they were soul mates and no minor argument shall be an obstacle to their personal happiness."

Candide discovers Pangloss, who has contracted syphilis, yet remains optimistic (""Dear Boy""*). The Inquisition appears, in the persons of two ancient Inquisitors and their lawyer, and many citizens are tried and sentenced to hang, including Candide and Dr. Pangloss (""The Inquisition: Auto-da-Fé""*).  Suddenly an earthquake occurs, killing Dr. Pangloss, and Candide barely escapes.Candide, faced with the loss of both Cunegonde and Dr. Pangloss, starts out for Paris.  He is unable to reconcile Dr. Pangloss's ideas with the bitter events that have occurred, but concludes that the fault must lie within himself, rather than in the philosophy of optimism (""It Must Be Me"").Cunegonde turns up alive in Paris (""The Paris Waltz""), a demi-mondaine in a house shared by a Marquis and a Sultan.  A party is in progress.  Urged by the Old Lady, who serves as her duenna, Cunegonde arrays herself in her jewels (""Glitter and Be Gay"").  Candide stumbles into the scene and is amazed to find Cunegonde still alive (""You Were Dead, You Know""). In a duel, he kills both the Marquis and the Sultan, and flees with Cunegonde, accompanied by the Old Lady.They fall in with a band of devout Pilgrims on their way to the New World and sail with them (""Pilgrims' Procession"" / ""Alleluia"").  Arriving in Buenos Aires, the group is brought to the Governor's Palace (where Maximilian is alive and working for the Governor), where all except Cunegonde and the Old Lady are immediately enslaved.  A street cleaner appears in the person of the pessimistic Martin, warning Candide of the future. Candide and Maximilian are joyfully reunited, but when Candide states his intention to marry Cunegonde Maximilian starts to strike him with a glove. Candide starts to strike him back, but before he actually does Maximilian drops, apparently dead.  The Governor serenades Cunegonde (""My Love"") and she, abetted by the Old Lady, agrees to live in the palace (""I Am Easily Assimilated""). The Old Lady urges Candide to flee, but Candide, fired by reports of Eldorado from Martin, sets off to seek his fortune, planning to return for Cunegonde later (""Quartet Finale"").Act 2In the heat of Buenos Aires, Cunegonde, the Old Lady and the Governor display their fraying nerves  (""Quiet""), and the Governor resolves to get rid of the tiresome ladies.  Candide returns from Eldorado (""Eldorado""), his pockets full of gold and searches for Cunegonde.  The Governor, however, has had both Cunegonde and the Old Lady tied up in sacks and carried to a boat in the harbor.  He tells Candide that the women have sailed for Europe, and Candide eagerly purchases a leaky ship from the Governor and dashes off.  As the Governor and his suite watch from his terrace, the ship with Candide and Martin casts off and almost immediately sinks (""Bon Voyage"").Candide and Martin have been rescued from the ship, and are floating about the ocean on a raft.  Martin is devoured by a shark, but Dr. Pangloss miraculously reappears.  Candide is overjoyed to find his old teacher, and Pangloss sets about repairing the damage done to his philosophy by Candide's experiences.In a luxurious palazzo of Venice (""Money, Money, Money""), Cunegonde turns up as a scrubwoman and the Old Lady as a woman of fashion (Madame Sofronia) (""What's the Use?""), both working as shills for Ferone, the owner of a gambling hall.  Candide and Dr. Pangloss, both wearing masks, appear and are caught up by the merriment, the wine and the gambling. Candide is accosted by a masked Cunegonde and Old Lady, who try to steal his remaining gold (""The Venice Gavotte""), but recognizes Cunegonde when her mask falls off. His last hopes and dreams shattered, he drops his money at her feet and leaves.  Cunegonde and the Old Lady are fired by Ferone and Pangloss is now penniless, having been completely swindled out of all his money.With Candide now completely disillusioned, he and Pangloss return to the ruined Westphalia.  Cunegonde, Maximilian (minus his teeth) and the Old Lady appear and within them a spark of optimism still flickers.  Candide, however, has had enough of the foolish Panglossian ideal and tells them all that the only way to live is to try to make some sense of life (""Make Our Garden Grow""). Bernstein ""Final Revised Version"" (1989) Act 1The operetta begins with an overture. The chorus welcomes everyone to Westphalia (""Westphalia Chorale"") and Voltaire begins to narrate his story. Candide, the illegitimate nephew of Baron Thunder-ten-Tronck, lives in the Baron's castle Schloss Thunder-ten-Tronck. He is snubbed by the Baroness and bullied by her son Maximilian. Paquette, a very accommodating serving girl, also lives in the castle. However, Candide is in love with Cunegonde, the Baroness' daughter as Maximilian, Candide, Cunegonde and Paquette find their happiness in life (""Life is Happiness Indeed""). The four discover that Dr. Pangloss, a man thought to be the world's greatest philosopher, has taught them happiness (""The Best of All Possible Worlds""). The philosopher asks his four students to summarize what they have learned (""Universal Good""). When Cunegonde spies Dr. Pangloss being physically intimate with Paquette, he explains it away as being a ""physical experiment"", and she decides to share the ""experiment"" with Candide. Professing their love to each other at a park, Candide and Cunegonde dream of what married life would look like (""Oh, Happy We""). The Baron, however, is angered at what Candide has done to Cunegonde, as he is a social inferior. Candide is promptly exiled, wandering alone with his faith and optimism to cling to (""It Must Be So""). He is then shanghaied by and into the Bulgar Army, which plots to ""liberate"" all of Westphalia. His escape attempt fails, and is recaptured by the Army. The Bulgar Army attacks Schloss Thunder-ten-Tronck and in the castle the Baron's family prays as the chorus joins in (""Westphalia""). However, the Baron, the Baroness, Maximilian, Paquette, Pangloss and (after being repeatedly ravished by the Bulgar Army) Cunegonde are all killed in the attack (""Battle Music""). Candide returns to the castle's ruins and searches for Cunegonde (""Candide's Lament"").Some time later, Candide becomes a beggar. He gives the last of his coins to Pangloss, who reveals that he was revived by an anatomist's scalpel. He then tells Candide of his syphilis condition brought on by Paquette (""Dear Boy""). A merchant offers the two employment before sailing off to Lisbon, Portugal. However, as they arrive, a volcano erupts and the ensuing earthquake results in the death of 30,000 people. Pangloss and Candide are blamed for the disaster, arrested as heretics and publicly tortured by order of the Grand Inquisitor. Pangloss is hanged and Candide is flogged (""Auto-da-Fé""). Candide eventually ends up in Paris, France, where Cunegonde shares her favors (on different mutually-agreed-upon days of the week) with wealthy Jew Don Issachar and the city's Cardinal Archbishop (""The Paris Waltz""). She contemplates what she has done to survive while in Paris (""Glitter and Be Gay""). Candide finds Cunegonde and reunites with her (""You Were Dead, You Know""). However, the Old Lady, Cunegonde's companion, forewarns Cunegonde and Candide of Issachar and the Archbishop's arrival. Candide inadvertently kills both of them by stabbing them with a sword.The three flee to Cadiz, Spain with Cunegonde's jewels, where the Old Lady tells Candide and Cunegonde about her past. The jewels are stolen and the Old Lady offers to sing for their dinner (""I Am Easily Assimilated""). The French police arrive, intending to arrest Candide for murdering Don Issachar and the Archbishop. Accepting an offer to fight for the Jesuits in South America, Candide decides to take Cunegonde and the Old Lady to the New World, and the three begin their journey on a ship (""Quartet Finale"").Act 2In Montevideo, Uruguay, Maximilian and Paquette, now revived and disguised as slave girls, reunite. Soon after, Don Fernando d'Ibaraa y Figueroa y Mascarenes y Lampourdos y Souza, the governor of the city, falls in love with Maximilian, but quickly realizes his mistake and sells him to a priest. Meanwhile, Candide, Cunegonde and the Old Lady also arrive in Montevideo, where the Governor falls in love with Cunegonde (""My Love""). The Old Lady convinces Cunegonde that her marriage to the governor will support her financially (""We Are Women""). Candide soon befriends Cacambo and accepts him as his valet. Convinced by the Old Lady that the police are still after Candide for the Archbishop's murder, Candide and Cacambo flee Montevideo and eventually stumble upon a Jesuit camp and are joined by the Father and Mother Superiors (""The Pilgrims' Procession – Alleluia""). Candide soon discovers that the Mother Superior is actually Paquette and the Father Superior is Maximilian. When Candide tells Maximilian that he will marry Cunegonde, however, Maximilian angrily challenges him to a fight. However, Maximilian is once again inadvertently stabbed to death by Candide. Candide is forced to flee into the jungle as a result.Three years later, Cunegonde and the Old Lady discuss the miseries shared by the upper classes while the Governor doesn't want to hear their complaints (""Quiet""). Meanwhile, Candide and Cacambo are starving and lost in the jungles. Finding a boat in the ocean, they float downriver into a cavern for 24 hours until they finally reach Eldorado, the city of gold (""Introduction to Eldorado""). The two discover that the locals worship one god as opposed to three, palaces of science, rosewater and stones with cinnamon and clove scents. Dissatisfied without Cunegonde, Candide decides to leave.  The locals think him foolish, but offer to help, giving him some of the town's golden sheep and constructing a lift that will guide him, Cacambo and the sheep over the mountain (""The Ballad of Eldorado""). One by one, the sheep die until only two remain. Unwilling to go back to Montevideo, Candide gives Cacambo one of the golden sheep to ransom Cunegonde, telling them that they will meet again in Venice, Italy.Arriving at Suriname, Candide meets Martin, a local pessimist. He shows him a slave with one hand and one foot lost while harvesting sugar-cane, which is the result of Europeans eating sugar; Candide is unable to convince Martin otherwise (""Words, Words, Words""). Vanderdendur, a Dutch villain, offers his ship, the Santa Rosalia, in exchange for the golden sheep. Candide is excited when he is told that the Santa Rosalia is to depart for Venice. The locals and Vandendur wish Candide a safe journey to Venice (""Bon Voyage""). However, the ship sinks and Martin drowns as a result. After reuniting with his golden sheep, Candide is picked up by a galley, meeting five deposed kings. The galley is rowed by slaves, including Pangloss, revived once again. The kings say that they will live humbly, serving both god and men, and Pangloss leads their debate (""The Kings' Barcarolle"").The ship arrives in Venice, where the Carnival festival is taking place (""Money, Money, Money""). While the kings play roulette and baccarat, Candide searches for Cunegonde. Maximilian, revived once again, is now the corrupt Prefect of Police and the town's leader. Paquette is now the town's reigning prostitute. Cunegonde and the Old Lady are employed to encourage the gamblers (""What's the Use?""). Pangloss celebrates a victory after winning roulette and spends his money on the other ladies (""The Venice Gavotte""). Candide, however, masked for the Carnival, is accosted by Cunegonde and the Old Lady (both of whom are also masked), who try to swindle him out of his money. During the exchange, all the masks come off and they are horrified to recognize each other.  Seeing what Cunegonde has become, Candide's image of and belief in her is shattered (""Nothing More Than This""). Candide does not speak for several days; with what little money they have left, they purchase a small farm outside Venice and the chorus says that life is just life and paradise is nothing (""Universal Good""). Candide finally speaks and resolves to marry Cunegonde (""Make Our Garden Grow"").","This musical does not have some kind of plot, all events are situation comedy – sitcom – occurring consecutively. None of the aspirations of the heroes are expressed nor they reach them. The musical tells the story of four main characters and Candide is the name of one of them. This man is an illegitimate nephew of Count. The count is also has beautiful and radiating bundles of libidinous voluptuousness maid named Paquette, daughter-virgin named Cunegonde, and the son Maximilian, very egocentric personality.  All these people are constantly involved in sitcoms: •	the revolution in Westphalia, with the result that the county is abolished and they are overthrown; •	someone always stick to Paquette, a maid, with the aim to seduce her; •	they are captured by pirates and go through war; •	some of them are sold into slavery and taken to the army, which is opposed to a monarchism; •	girls travel between brothels and other public homes, where they perform an understandable role; •	on the way the characters even go to heaven on Earth – the legendary Golden City of Eldorado, which is inhabited by creatures who do not know hunger, injustice and all there are infinitely happy and live in harmony, even animals. In addition to the said designation, much more happens to them.  It's a comedy, which purpose is not to tell the story but to show the sitcom and to act a funny thing."
Starlight Express," Starlight Express has been revised many times since it was first produced. Each professional production has differed from the last. These differences range from tweaks to lyrics, to the omission or inclusion of entire songs, characters and sub-plots. Throughout Starlight Express’s history, however, the fundamental story has stayed the same: a young but obsolete steam engine, Rusty, races in a championship against modern engines in the hope of impressing a first-class carriage, Pearl.This plot summary reflects the show as it was first produced, in the West End in 1984. Act 1 Late at night, a child plays with his toy trains. Calling himself Control, he presides over a championship to decide which of his trains is ""the fastest in the world"". He falls asleep and, in his dreams, the championship begins.The reigning champion — a Union Pacific diesel engine called Greaseball — enters with his gang. They boast of diesel's supremacy (""Rolling Stock""). Next, a steam engine called Rusty enters. Greaseball mocks Rusty, who replies that he will win the championship, despite steam being obsolete compared to diesel (""Call Me Rusty""). Control intervenes and orders Rusty to collect the coaches from the marshalling yard. Rusty returns with the coaches: a dining car called Dinah, a smoking car called Ashley, a buffet car called Buffy, and a first-class car called Pearl. Control sends Rusty away to fetch the freight trucks as the coaches introduce themselves to the audience (""A Lotta Locomotion""). Greaseball returns. He boasts again, this time to the coaches (""Pumping Iron""). Rusty returns with the six cars that make up the freight train: three boxcars called Rocky 1, Rocky 2 and Rocky 3; a brick truck called Flat Top; an aggregate hopper called Dustin; and a brake truck called C.B. They introduce themselves to the audience and argue with the coaches over whether it is preferable to carry people or cargo (""Freight"").Control declares entries for the championship open. Six trains arrive to challenge Greaseball: Bobo, a French TGV; Espresso, the Italian Rome to Milan Express; Weltschaft, the German Intercity-Express; Turnov, a Russian engine on the Trans-Siberian Railway; Hashamoto, a Japanese bullet train; and The City of Milton Keynes, an Advanced Passenger Train from Great Britain. Entries are about to close when a surprise entry arrives: Electra, an electric train. Accompanied by his five components—an armaments truck called Krupp, a repair truck called Wrench, a money truck called Purse, a freezer truck called Volta, and an animal truck called Joule — Electra declares that electricity is the future of speed (""AC/DC""). Greaseball and Electra square up to each other as the entrants form a parade to celebrate the race (""Coda of Freight"").Control announces the rules of the championship: the trains will compete in pairs, with an engine pulling a coach. There will be three elimination heats, and the winner of each heat will move on to the finals to decide the fastest train. The engines start to pick their coaches. Rusty offers to race with Pearl, but she rejects him, explaining that she is waiting for her 'dream train' (""He Whistled at Me""). Electra's messenger, Purse, enters with an invitation from Electra. Even though Electra is not her dream train either, she accepts, leaving Rusty alone.The first heat pits Greaseball and Dinah against Espresso and Buffy, and Hashamoto and C.B.. C.B. sabotages Hashamoto by applying his brakes at key moments in the race. Greaseball and Dinah win comfortably, claiming a place in the finals. After the race, Dinah objects to Greaseball's cheating. In response he abandons her and C.B. comforts Dinah (""There's Me""). Meanwhile, a lonely Rusty has retreated to the freight yard where an old steam train called Poppa—a former champion—is singing a blues song to the freight cars (""Poppa's Blues""). Poppa tries to persuade Rusty to race without Pearl, urging him to have faith in a mythical force he calls the Starlight Express. When Rusty refuses, Poppa introduces him to an old sleeping car called Belle (""Belle The Sleeping Car""). Rusty agrees to race with Belle. They compete in the second heat against Electra and Pearl, and Weltschaft and Joule. Electra and Pearl finish first, securing a place in the finals; Rusty and Belle finish in last place.Already despondent after losing Pearl as his race partner, Rusty loses his last shreds of confidence. Poppa decides to step up and prove that steam power is still relevant, despite everyone's misgivings, by racing himself in the third heat. Only Dustin, the heavy aggregate hopper, is willing to race with him. Rusty points out that the race is already full, but suddenly Control announces that the British train has been scrapped, leaving space for a late entry. Poppa interprets this as a sign from the Starlight Express and enters the race. The third heat pits Poppa and Dustin against Bobo and Ashley, and Turnov and Wrench. Poppa wins the race, securing a place in the finals against Greaseball and Electra, but the effort of outracing the others and pulling the hefty Dustin exhausts him. Now worn out, he begs Rusty to take his place. Rusty refuses at first, but then he notices Pearl with Electra and is jealous. When C.B. offers to race with him, Rusty announces that he will take Poppa's place. Greaseball and the other competitors mock him then leave. Alone, Rusty prays to the Starlight Express for help in the finals (""Starlight Express""). Act 2 The trains debate whether Rusty should be allowed to take Poppa's place in the finals, since he's already competed and lost, or whether the place should go instead to Bobo, who finished second in Poppa's heat (""The Rap""). They ultimately decide to let Rusty race. Control offers the engines the chance to change partners. Pearl abandons Electra and joins Greaseball, leaving Dinah feeling betrayed. Dinah expresses her shame at being uncoupled, although she cannot bring herself to say the word itself (""U.N.C.O.U.P.L.E.D.""). Ashley, Buffy and Belle try to persuade Dinah to fight for Greaseball's affections (""Rolling Stock (Reprise)""), but instead she accepts an offer from Electra to replace Pearl in the finals. Elsewhere, C.B. hatches a plan. He tells Greaseball he will help him win the championship by sabotaging Rusty. He then tells Electra he will wipe out Greaseball, clearing the way for Electra to win. When Electra expresses his surprise at C.B.'s duplicity, C.B. explains that he has spent a career secretly causing train crashes for fun (""C.B."").The finals takes place between Electra and Dinah, Greaseball and Pearl, and Rusty and C.B. C.B. sabotages Rusty, slowing him down so he misses a switch on the tracks and cannot finish the race. Electra and Greaseball finish in a dead heat. Control announces that there will be another race, with Electra and Greaseball going head-to-head to decide the winner. Rusty complains that he was cheated, but the marshals refuse to listen. Pearl confronts Greaseball, but he warns her to say nothing, as the marshals would consider her complicit and punish her as well. Rusty retreats to the freight yard, where he bumps into the Rockies. They tell him that without luck, he will never win and that he should just give up. (""Right Place, Right Time""). The Rockies leave Rusty alone. He appeals again to the mythical Starlight Express for help, and this time, it hears. The Starlight Express appears in front of Rusty, reminding him that whatever strength he needs–the starlight–is within him already (""I Am The Starlight""). The Starlight Express disappears and Rusty finds himself back in the freight yard with Dustin, who says he was just asleep, but felt the starlight's presence. Rusty asks Dustin to race with him in the final. He accepts and they head off together.Moments before the race, Dinah, angry with the way Electra treats her, disconnects from him. Electra quickly appeals to C.B. to take her place. The trains gather to watch what they expect will be a head-to-head final between Greaseball and Pearl, and Electra and C.B.. Suddenly Rusty arrives with Dustin, and the marshals allow him to enter the race. The race is fast and furious. This time, the downhill track turns Dustin's weight into an advantage for Rusty. Greaseball struggles with an unwilling Pearl holding him back, and Electra uses all his power to disrupt his opponents. Electra zaps electricity at Greaseball, but misses and injures Pearl. Greaseball, showing no concern, simply disconnects Pearl at full speed. Rusty diverts from the race course just in time to save her, but at the cost of falling into a distant third place. To avoid being disqualified for not having a coach, Greaseball starts to grapple with Electra over C.B. The fight degenerates into chaos and Greaseball, Electra and C.B. crash, allowing Rusty to win the race. But instead of celebrating, he leaves immediately to find Pearl. Control warns that, if Rusty doesn’t return quickly, his lap of honour will be cancelled.Meanwhile, humiliated and furious, Electra leaves the race track, swearing never to return (""No Comeback""). Greaseball and C.B. emerge in a tangled wreck. They lament the heavy toll that racing has taken on them  (""One Rock 'n' Roll Too Many""). Poppa demands that Greaseball and C.B. help find Rusty. Away from the other engines, Pearl fears that she caused Rusty to lose the race. She realises that of all the trains she's raced with, only Rusty ever acted selflessly towards her (""Only He""). Rusty arrives. He tells Pearl that he won the race and confesses his love for her (""Only You""). The other trains arrive. Greaseball finally apologises to Dinah for his behaviour and they reconcile. Greaseball complains that he's finished as a racer, but Poppa offers to rebuild him as a steam engine. Control tries to assert some control, announcing that Rusty's lap of honour is cancelled. Tired of Control's behaviour, Poppa and the other engines tell Control to shut it and celebrate the second coming of steam power (""Light at the End of the Tunnel"").","Little boy is playing with his children's toy trains, arranging competitions between them. Enters his mother and puts the child to sleep. Further continues the exciting story of the toy trains, already occurring in the dreams of a boy. Between the compositions of various models from different countries will be a racing for the title of the fastest train in the world. All trains have a locomotive and a variety of cars, each of which is a full-fledged member of the musical. Viewers will see passenger and freight cars, buffet car, weapons and cash cars, trains for smokers and non-smokers, and many other cars of different classes, assignments and modifications. Voices behind the scenes will be God of all trains (Starlight Express), murmur of the sleeping boy and his mother's voice.  The current champion is a diesel, which has a team of diesel friends, praising their idol. In the race will even take part a sad steam-locomotive standing on side rails and long dreamed to participate in this exciting event. Gradually, on the stage will appear high-speed express trains from France, Italy, Germany, Japan & Great Britain. The race will begin under the constant supervision of judges. As a new member will be the burst is late – bright and modern – electro train. As a result, in pairs, all trains will begin to compete with each other. Gradually will be selected compounds for the quarter-finals, semi-finals and, finally, for the finals. Left out of the race will be watching for event from aside, communicating with each other. In parallel to the competition, the beholder sees the difficult relationship between locomotives and cars, there will be a place for love and deceit, cunning and devotion. By means of division of trains on classes, viewers will see the unusual, but recognizable allusions to contemporary trends in the world’s society."
Once Upon a Mattress,"  Act I A fictional medieval kingdom in 15th-Century Europe is ruled by the devious Queen Aggravain and the mute King Sextimus the Silent. King Sextimus suffers from a curse that can only be reversed ""when the mouse devours the hawk."" The Minstrel sings of the Princess and the Pea (""Many Moons Ago""), but reveals the story to be fake, though he knows the true tale because he was there when it happened. The princess in the story is not the first princess tested to see if she is worthy of marrying Prince Dauntless the Drab—she is the thirteenth princess. The day the Minstrel arrives, the Queen, alongside her confidante, the Wizard, is testing Princess #12 with an unfair quiz. To the Queen's delight, the princess misses the last question: ""What was the middle name of the daughter-in-law of the best friend of the blacksmith who forged the sword that killed the Beast?"" and is given a rubber chicken by Sir Studley. The populace of the castle complains about an unjust law levied by Queen Aggravain: ""Throughout the land no one may wed, 'till Dauntless shares his wedding bed.""  However, every petitioning princess is sent away after failing unfair tests devised by the Queen. It seems that no one is good enough to marry Prince Dauntless (""An Opening for A Princess"").The crisis escalates when the leading knight of the realm, Sir Harry, discovers that his girlfriend, Lady Larken, is pregnant. Though Lady Larken says that she will run away so he will never have to face embarrassment and the loss of his station, Sir Harry decides that he will set out to find a princess himself (""In a Little While""). He petitions the Queen who immediately says no, but when Dauntless manages to speak up and beg, she gives in.The Minstrel tells us that in the original story, the princess arrived at the castle on a stormy night (Many Moons Ago - Reprise), but it is not night at all-and the princess only looked as though she went through a storm. Princess Winnifred the Woebegone, a brash and unrefined princess from the marshlands, was so eager to arrive that she swam the castle moat. She immediately charms Dauntless, Studley, and the knights and most of the kingdom (""Shy""). However, she also earns the utter loathing of the evil Queen, who vows to stop her.The King discovers Larken's pregnancy and pantomimes this to his confidantes, the Minstrel and the Jester. He tells them to not say a word, but they both are more worried about the King letting it slip, because even though he's mute, he can still communicate (""The Minstrel, the Jester, and I""). Later, the Queen, assisted by the Wizard, designs a test for Winnifred based on something they are sure she hasn't got at all—sensitivity. They will place a tiny pea beneath twenty thick downy mattresses. If Winnifred is unable to sleep due to the pea, then she will be sensitive enough to marry Dauntless (""Sensitivity"").Meanwhile, Winnifred tells Dauntless and the ladies in waiting about her home in the swamp (""The Swamps of Home"") and meets the King, and they immediately like each other. Then, after spilling a purple vase filled with fresh new baby's breath, Winnifred is caught cleaning the mess by Lady Larken who mistakes her for a chambermaid. Soon Harry gets mad at Larken for her mistake and they get in a fight. Larken vows that she will run far far away where she will never see him again.The King, the Minstrel and the Jester catch Larken trying to run away, and they try to stop her but in the end decide to help her escape to Normandy (""Normandy""). Later that night, the Queen throws a ball so Winnifred can dance the most exhausting dance in the world, ""The Spanish Panic"".  The Queen hopes that Winnifred will tire herself, but the plan fails. Winnifred is the last one standing as everyone collapses from exhaustion at the dance's climax. She asks Dauntless to try to give her a clue as to what the test might be, but he's not sure. He brings out a huge barbell that one of the princesses was asked to lift, but even he cannot lift it. Winnifred does easily and Dauntless admits that he loves her. Winnifred mentions that her nickname is Fred and Dauntless sings of his love for her as she practices numerous tasks she might have to do for the test, including singing, dancing, wrestling, acting, playing the Minstrel's lute, pantomiming and drinking herself unconscious (""Song of Love""). Act II Later that night the Queen leads the knights and ladies as they carry the twenty mattresses to Fred's room (""Quiet""), and she catches the Minstrel, the Jester, the King, and Larken (disguised in Dauntless' clothes) running away. The Minstrel tries to protect Larken by saying he was escaping with Larken against her will. The Queen declares that the Minstrel will be banished by daybreak. Fred and Dauntless study for the test, and Fred convinces Larken to fix things with Harry. Larken leaves to find Harry, Dauntless bids Fred goodnight, and now she is left alone. While studying a fairytale, she complains about how other fairy tale princesses had it easy and how she wants to live happily ever after (""Happily Ever After"").  King Sextimus has a man to man talk  with Dauntless about the birds and the bees completely in pantomime (""Man to Man Talk""). The Jester and Minstrel trick the Wizard into telling them of the test and the Jester reminisces about his father's dancing days (""Very Soft Shoes"").Sir Harry and Lady Larken run into each other and they confess that their love is stronger than ever (""Yesterday I Loved You""). When Fred is finally ready for bed, the Queen brings in various people, including the Nightingale of Samarkand, to sing her to sleep (""Nightingale Lullaby"") but Winnifred is kept wide awake. It seems that there is some ""lump"" under the mattresses that is keeping her from relaxing. She starts counting sheep.Dauntless dresses in his finest to see Winnifred pass the test, but the Queen tells him to his great disappointment that the test has already happened and what it was. Dauntless is heartbroken until Winnifred drowsily stumbles into the throne room while still counting sheep. Everyone is ecstatic that Winnifred has passed but the Queen insists that Dauntless shouldn't throw himself away on Winnifred.  Dauntless has had enough of his mother's attempts to control his life and finally yells, ""I told you to shut up!"".  The curse on King Sextimus is lifted (the ""mouse""- Dauntless, has metaphorically devoured the ""hawk""- Queen Aggravain). Aggravain discovers that she cannot talk and the King can, so Dauntless and Winnifred are free to be married. The King forces the Queen to hop, skip, and jump around the room to everyone's amusement, and with this, she is forced step down.Finally the real reason why Winnifred passed the test is revealed. After learning about the test, the King, Minstrel, and Jester stuffed the mattresses full of weapons, jousting equipment, and other sharp items.  All the items are removed by the Jester in the finale (""Finale""). After the items are removed Winnifred still has trouble sleeping until Dauntless takes the pea out from under the mattress, when she then falls asleep almost immediately. Everyone, in classic fairy-tale tradition, lives happily ever after.","The ruler of ancient realm was speechless because of the damnation. Ruler could only speak when ‘the mouse will destroy falcon’. Ahead of his country stood Queen named Aggravain. A minstrel sang a song about the princess & the pease. He knew the whole truth about this telling. She has been already 13th candidate that had to undergo tests to become a fiancée for the local dynast. Minstrel came on that day when 12th contender has not handled the probation. The inhabitants of the country could not marry because the Queen has introduced a ban on espousing. They will be able to play weddings only when their prince marries. Sir Harry knows that his girlfriend Lady Larken was pregnant. But he could not marry her because Aggravain’s decree. Knight decided to find a decent girl for the Prince. Queen released Sir Harry on a quest only after the interpellation of son of him.  Winnifred was so desperately willing to become the future bride that even swam across the trench.

Soon she met with Ruler.  Princess accidentally broke a rare vase. Lady Larken considered her a maid, as she began to clean up the debris. Because of this, she had a quarrel with Sir Harry & promised to get away from him as far as possible. King and his associates decided to halt the lady, but failed to convince her to stay. The Queen made the candidate to fulfill the most continuous dance in the whole world ever. But Winnifred easily passed that test.

She was able to sleep properly only when the prince got out of bed also a pea."
A Christmas Carol," The opening numbers are ""The Years Are Passing By"" and ""Jolly, Rich, and Fat"". In later productions the two numbers are combined as ""Jolly Good Time."" Scrooge first encounters the three ghosts of Christmas in their real-world guises as a lamplighter (Past), a charity show barker (Present), and a blind beggar woman (Future) (""Nothing to Do With Me""). Scrooge's long-suffering employee Bob Cratchit, and Bob's son Tiny Tim, purchase a Christmas chicken (""You Mean More to Me"").The visit of the ghost of Jacob Marley (""Link By Link""), features a half-dozen singing, dancing spirits presented with various levels of makeup and special effects. One of these ghosts in this version is known to be an old colleague of Scrooge and Marley's, Mr. Haynes, who was said to be ""mean to the bone"", resulting in his charred skeleton. Other puns include a spirit with a safe embedded in his chest, who ""never had a heart"".The Ghost of Christmas Past reinforces the character's signature theme of illuminating Scrooge's worldview (""The Lights of Long Ago""). One notable departure from Dickens' novella in this portion of the film is its depiction of Ebenezer Scrooge's father, identified as John William Scrooge, being sentenced to debtors' prison while his horrified family looks on; this scene was inspired by an actual occurrence from Dickens' own childhood.The Ghost of Christmas Present (""Abundance and Charity"" and ""Christmas Together""), makes his point that Christmas is a time for celebration, generosity, and fellowship. The former takes place at a fantastical version of the charity show he was seen promoting on Christmas Eve, and the latter whisks Scrooge on a tour of London that includes the homes of his nephew Fred, his clerk Bob Cratchit, and Mr. Smythe, a recently widowed client of Scrooge's lending house.The entire Christmas Future (""Dancing On Your Grave"", ""You Mean More to Me (Reprise)"", and ""Yesterday, Tomorrow, and Today""), culminates in Scrooge's awakening in his bedroom on Christmas morning.""What a Day, What a Sky"" bookends ""Nothing to Do With Me"", dramatizing Scrooge's new outlook as he races through the streets of London making amends. The show concludes with a reprise of ""Christmas Together"" featuring the entire cast.","The good old fairy tale about the spirits of Christmas, which comes to Ebenezer Scrooge – miser, on behalf of which was even Scrooge McDuck named, as the personification of causeless, avaricious greed only for gaining money. The three first spirits of Christmas are shown in their human forms – igniter of road lights (while they still was working on gas or kerosene and had to be alight every evening, and to extinguished every morning) (a spirit of Past), a clicker in charity musical (represents the Present), blind woman-beggar (Future). The main characters of the musical – the family of an honest young man who works for the mentioned miser, so greedy that his office/home is terribly cold, almost like outside the street and all workers have to freeze out there, working in the street clothes.  Bob Cratchit – a worker of Scrooge, buys a chicken for Christmas with his son. The appearance of the spirit of Jacob Marley is depicted as a dozen of people that dance and play scenes from everyday life. One of the spirits shows old colleague of Scrooge, the same, if not more, meanie, which had safe with money instead of the heart. Needless to say that no one in the city likes Scrooge, which is evil and powerful, and beating the local poor with a stick every time he passes by him. The purpose of Scrooge – the accumulation of money and he spends ridiculously little, putting everything in the safe, even what could be spent on food.  The father of Ebenezer Scrooge owed a lot of money and as a result, he was sentenced to prison for debts, and he had to leave while his family was looking for him. This is a reference to the childhood of the writer Charles Dickens, his dad acted like that.  A Spirit of the Present shows us a very bright version of the charity show, which was held in the name of love and the fame of Christmas, when people have to share and to celebrate & to show sincerity. Spirits collectively depict to Scrooge that he lives improperly through the prism of joy and happiness in the homes of ordinary people, he sees his employees hate him because they cannot afford to buy even the most necessary things for them and their families, because he pays them badly. He sees scenes where people gain more in return when they give. As a result, by the end of the play, we see how this all changes the miser Scrooge. He becomes an openhearted, his face gains a smile, and he begins, though slowly, to be"

Back at the castle, Anna is delivered to Hans, but rather than kissing her, he reveals that he has been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters (""Hans of the Southern Isles"" (reprise 2)).

Shortly before the invasion of Napoleon's army. Pierre is a rich aristocrat, who is in a deep spiritual crisis. His life is filled with wine, philosophy and sloth. At the same time, young Natasha Rostova and her cousin came to the capital to Marya – they were going to stay at hers all winter. She was the godmother of Natalia. She was expecting her groom Andrey to return from the war. Marya recommended to own goddaughter to visit her fiancé’s father and sister. Good relations with these nobles could in the future help her family to improve financial position. A visit to the old Count Bolkonsky and his daughter was unsuccessful – the girl was unable to win their love. Natasha even more began to miss her fiancé.  The next night, the girl entered a secular Moscow society – she attended the opera. There she met Anatole, the young officer who was well-known ladies' man and a deceiver. After his courtship, Natasha began to experience confused and mixed feelings. Now, her love for Andrey seemed not as strong as she thought of it. Anatole and his friends left the room. Soon they met a sister of Anatole. She quarreled with her husband because of his behavior with other friend. Anatole said that he would achieve Natasha’s love. The officer did not stop even in the presence of his own wife. Pierre called Dolokhov on a duel that from his side was a suicide. Then the man began to reflect about his life.  Sunday morning Rostova with family and friends attended church. Soon they came to Helene. The woman invited Natasha to the ball – this is where Anatole was going to seduce her. The venture of a womanizer did not fail – the officer was able to win the heart of an inexperienced girl. Soon they planned a joint elopement. Natasha broke off her engagement to Andrey, writing him a letter. When Sonya learned about all what was happening, she realized that this action would destroy her cousin. She decided to stop a girl by all means. The same evening Anatole and Dolokhov arrived to the house where Natalia lived. But the planned runaway failed – instead of a girl Marya came out on the porch and drove them away.  Having dealt with failed kidnappers, a woman scolded her goddaughter. Then she sent a message to Pierre, asking him for help – immediate expelling of Anatole from the capital required. Natalia could not survive such exposure and tried to poison herself. Soon Bolkonsky returned. Pierre told him about the scandal that happened with his ex-fiancée, and asked him to be merciful to the girl. But the angry Count would not listen to the opinion of his friend. Soon, Pierre visited sick Natalia. After their meeting, the man survived the moment of enlightenment, when he saw a great comet in the sky of 1812."

When his soldiers capture a group of Nubian women, he is captivated by one of the women, Aida, who tries to free herself by out-dueling one of his soldiers. Radames forces her to wash his back, but she refuses, saying that although the Egyptians took everything from the Nubians, they will never take their spirit (""The Past Is Another Land""). Radames saves Aida's companions from the copper mines (and certain death) by sending them to the palace groundskeeper instead. He also ensures Aida serves as a handmaiden to his betrothed, Princess Amneris. Radames' father, Chief Minister Zoser, greets his son with news that the Pharaoh is dying, and Radames must prepare to become the next ruler of Egypt (""Another Pyramid""). Unbeknownst to Radames, his father is poisoning the Pharaoh in order to accelerate Radames' ascension to the throne.Radames' Nubian servant, Mereb, is a young man who has learned the tricks of survival in Egypt. While delivering Aida to the princess, Mereb recognizes her as the daughter of the Nubian king under whom he had served during his days in Nubia. She commands him to keep her identity a secret, lest the Egyptians kill her (""How I Know You""). Presented to Amneris, Aida is liked immediately, and she perceives that the Princess' love of fashion only serves as a mask of her insecurities (""My Strongest Suit""). At a banquet, Amneris and Radames learn from the Pharaoh that they are to marry in seven days, leaving the captain distraught that his days as an explorer have ended (""Fortune Favors the Brave (Reprise)""). Together, he and Aida share their dreams and regrets (""Enchantment Passing Through"").Later that night, Amneris worries about her father's illness, and finds in Aida someone who understands and encourages her (""My Strongest Suit (Reprise)"").

Aida is taken by Mereb to the Nubian camp, where she reluctantly submits to her people's pleas to lead them (""Dance of the Robe""). When she implores Radames to help the Nubians, he opens his heart by giving his possessions to them (""Not Me"") and declaring his love for Aida (""Elaborate Lives""). Unable to fight her feelings any longer, she falls into his embrace. Their bliss is interrupted by news that Radames' armies have captured Amonasro, king of Nubia and also Aida's father. Unable to comfort her, Radames leaves Aida in distress. Rallying her people, Aida assures them that Nubia will never die (""The Gods Love Nubia"").Act 2Amneris, Radames, and Aida are entangled in conflicted loyalties and emotions (""A Step Too Far""): Amneris is afraid that Radames's affection for her is waning, Radames worries his love for Aida could end his life as he knows it, and Aida fears she might be a traitor to her people as she loves Radames. Aida and Mereb bribe their way into Amonasro's prison cell, where she is reunited with her father. Mereb hatches a plan to escape with the king during the commotion of Amneris' wedding. To save her father and her nation, Aida must betray the man she loves (""Easy as Life"").

After an emotional bout with his son, Zoser orders his men to find Aida and kill her.At the Nubian camp, Aida receives a written apology from Radames for the thoughtless way he acted upon hearing of Amonasro's capture (""Radames' Letter"") and for his lack of showing affection. When Egyptian soldiers arrive seeking Aida, another Nubian, Nehebka, sacrifices herself so that the princess can live. Now even more determined to leave Radames forever, Aida goes to say good-bye to him over Mereb's objections (""How I Know You (Reprise)""). Radames informs Aida that he is calling off the wedding. Aida knows that this would ruin her father's escape and tells him he must go through with it (""Written in the Stars""). Radames agrees, on condition that she escapes to freedom on a boat he will provide. The heartbroken lovers part, but Amneris has overheard their entire conversation and tries to face the fact that her upcoming marriage is a sham (""I Know the Truth"").News of Amonasro's escape disrupts Amneris' wedding. Radames learns the truth of Aida's identity when he arrives at the docks just as she is about to board his boat with her father. Although he is angry that Aida hid this from him, she says she never lied about loving him. In the ensuing chaos, Mereb is mortally wounded by Zoser, and Radames makes possible Amonasro's escape by cutting the rope tied to the dock, but Aida stays with Radames and a dying Mereb. Zoser flees, and Mereb dies in the arms of his kind master and beloved princess. Radames and Aida are then arrested for treason. At the ensuing trial, Pharaoh announces Zoser's apprehension and sentences both Aida and Radames to be buried alive. Amneris foreshadows her role as a future Pharaoh by convincing her father to let the lovers die in the same tomb, an act of mercy for two people she has come to love. Facing death, Aida looks to Radames for strength (""Elaborate Lives (Reprise)"").  As they are slowly deprived of light and air (""Enchantment Passing Through (Reprise)""), Radames swears he will search through a hundred lifetimes to find her again if he has to.Back in the contemporary museum, the spirit of Amneris reveals that as she became Pharaoh, ""the lovers' deaths gave birth to a reign of peace"" between Egypt and Nubia.  She watches as the modern man and woman are strangely drawn to each other.  They are the reincarnations of Aida and Radames, finding each other in a new beginning (""Every Story is a Love Story (Reprise)"").","With this play, we are transported to ancient Egypt, during the heyday of the pharaohs and the maximum power of the empire.

The Light in the Piazza," Act 1In the early morning of their first day in Florence, Margaret reads from her guidebook to Clara as the piazza around them is waking up and coming to life (""Statues and Stories""). A breeze carries Clara's hat off her head and across the square where a young Italian man, Fabrizio, catches it, mid-air, and returns it to her. The two are instantly smitten. But Margaret steers her daughter away from the encounter, bringing her next to the Uffizi Gallery where the reaching figures in the paintings speak to Clara of her own yearnings (""The Beauty Is""). Fabrizio appears, hoping to arrange a time to meet with Clara, but once again Margaret intervenes.Alone, Fabrizio sings in Italian his declaration of love at first sight for Clara, along with a heartfelt cry of fear that she could never love anyone as lost and without position as he (""Il Mondo Era Vuoto""). Fabrizio begs his father and his brother Giuseppe to help him dress more presentably for Clara. Giuseppe attempts to teach Fabrizio some dance steps as well (""American Dancing"").At the Duomo, Fabrizio once again catches up with Margaret and Clara, and this time Fabrizio's father, Signor Naccarelli, is able to help penetrate Margaret's resistance to any further involvement. They all agree to meet at sunset to take a walk and admire the view of the city from above at the Piazzale Michelangelo (""Passeggiata"").Margaret and Clara are invited to have tea at the Naccarelli home. Giuseppe's wife, Franca, takes Clara on a tour of the apartment, and alone in a separate room, she warns Clara about how quickly love can stale in marriage (""The Joy You Feel""). Though the Naccarellis are universally impressed with Clara, Margaret tries without success to share her deep reservations. When she looks in Fabrizio's eyes and sees the love there, she cannot bring herself to disappoint him, as much as she feels she must; for there is something about Clara that none of these people know. Clara secretly makes plans to meet Fabrizio at midnight near the hotel.Margaret calls her husband Roy, who is back in the states. She tries to tell him what is happening with Clara and Fabrizio, but he is brusque and not very understanding, cutting short the conversation. Margaret, alone in her hotel room, reflects on the loneliness in her marriage (""Dividing Day""). She checks in Clara's room, and finds that she is missing.On her way to meet Fabrizio, Clara becomes lost in the maze-like streets of Florence. She loses all poise and control, becoming hysterical and screaming like a child (""Hysteria""). Her mother takes her back to the hotel and, as Clara sleeps, reveals the source of her disquiet. When Clara was a young girl, she was kicked in the head by a Shetland pony, and the accident has caused her mental and emotional abilities to develop abnormally. Margaret feels that she must take Clara away from Florence at once, and she steps down into the lobby to have a drink. While she is away, Fabrizio comes to the room, distraught; he cannot find the right words to express his feelings, and Clara urges him to use any other means; Clara accepts Fabrizio's proposal of marriage, and the two are embracing, half undressed, as Margaret walks in on them (""Say It Somehow"").Act 2Margaret takes Clara to Rome to distract her and put an end to the affair. Back in Florence, the Naccarelli household is in complete chaos. As the family despairs, Signora Naccarelli translates in an aside; Fabrizio believes he has ruined everything with Clara, his father attempts to comfort him, and Giuseppe and Franca desire finer details (""Aiutami"").No matter what Margaret tries, her daughter refuses to give her an inch, culminating in a painful confrontation wherein Margaret slaps Clara across the face. Clara erupts with a torrent of feeling, centered on Fabrizio and the nature of love (""The Light in the Piazza""). This causes Margaret to relent, to set aside her doubts and considerations, and to no longer stand in the way of the wedding. The two return to Florence.Clara is instructed in the Latin catechism in preparation for converting to Catholicism while around her everyone in the extended family sings of their feelings, stirred up by the immediate presence of such intense, young love (""Octet Part 1""). Franca, in an attempt to arouse her husband's jealousy, kisses Fabrizio right on the mouth, and Clara witnesses it, breaking into a furious rant that ends with her throwing a drink on Franca. As Clara breaks down, Franca commends her for her bravery and declares her own desire to fight for Giuseppe. She toasts the upcoming union and is joined by the rest of the family (""Octet Part 2"").At the wedding rehearsal, Clara and Fabrizio are filling out the necessary forms when Signor Naccarelli sees something on Clara's form that causes him to call off the wedding and take his family away at once. Clara wants to know what is wrong with her, but her mother says there is nothing at all wrong. With Clara sobbing and broken, alone in one of the pews of the church, Margaret reveals her worst fears and her shame at having been the source of her daughter's lifelong suffering. She resolves to do whatever it takes to give Clara a chance for happiness (""The Beauty Is [Reprise]"").Margaret tries to reason with Signor Naccarelli, who saw Clara's childlike handwriting as she completed her marriage form. Seemingly unconcerned with her immaturity or her handwriting, Signor Naccarelli admits that he saw Clara write her age on the forms – 26 – and that this makes her an unsuitable bride for his son who is only 20. Relieved that he has not discovered their secret, Margaret begs him to change his mind, but he will not. She invites him to take a walk with her, and the two wander from one end of Florence to the other as the sun slowly sets and the night comes on (""Let's Walk""). By giving him time to mull things over and by not pressuring him, Margaret succeeds in putting the wedding back on track; Signor Naccarelli says he will meet them at the church the following morning.From the hotel room, Margaret calls Roy to tell him about the wedding. As might be predicted, he insists that Clara cannot handle the responsibilities of marriage. Clara, in her wedding dress, stands in the shadows, overhearing her mother's side of the conversation. Margaret says, ""Just because she isn't normal, Roy, doesn't mean she's consigned to a life of loneliness. She mustn't be made to accept less from life just because she isn't like you or me."" Shattered, Clara slips out of the hotel room and runs once more through Florence (""Interlude""), meeting Fabrizio at the church in order to tell him that she cannot marry him; she won't allow herself to cause him any pain. Fabrizio assuages all of her fears (""Love to Me"").Moments before the wedding, Clara tells Margaret she can't leave her; Margaret assures her she can. Left alone, Margaret breaks open all the repressed doubts and yearnings that she has carried for years on end about love, realizing at last that the chance of love somehow outweighs the terrible risks. She joins the wedding ceremony (""Fable"").","Early morning in Florence. Spending here her first day, Margaret's daughter Clara reads an article from the guide. It describes how the appearance of the sun's rays blossoms & breathes life onto marketplace. Suddenly, a strong wind blows the hat off the head of Clara & it starts to fly across the place.

Shrek the Musical," of the Broadway production  Act I Two ogre parents send their seven-year-old son Shrek out of their house and into the world to make his living. They warn him that because of his looks, he will be shunned by the world, and an angry mob will be the last thing he will see before he dies. Some years later, an embittered, grown up Shrek is living contentedly alone in a swamp (""Big, Bright, Beautiful World""). However, his solitude is disrupted when a refugee caravan of fairytale creatures show up on his property. They explain of their banishment from the Kingdom of Duloc, by order of the evil Lord Farquaad, who sentenced them into penal transportation for being freaks, under penalty of death if they ever return (""Story of my Life""). Although hesitant, Shrek decides to travel to see Farquaad and try to regain his swamp, along with getting the Fairytale Creatures their homes back, with much encouragement from Pinocchio and the gang (""The Goodbye Song"").Along the way, Shrek rescues a talkative Donkey from some of Farquaad's guards. In return for rescuing him, and offering his friendship, Donkey insists on tagging along to show him the way to Duloc, which Shrek reluctantly agrees to, due to him being lost (""Don't Let Me Go"").Meanwhile, in the Kingdom of Duloc, Farquaad is torturing The Gingerbread Man into revealing the whereabouts of other Fairytale Creatures that are still hiding in his Kingdom so he can have them arrested as well. Just as Gingy was going to reveal what he knows, the Captain of the guards arrives and announces that they have found the Magic Mirror. Farquaad asked the mirror if Duloc was the most perfect kingdom of them all. The mirror told him that he's not truly a king yet, but he can become one if he marries a princess. For this episode of ""This Is Your Wife"" (a parody of The Dating Game), the mirror introduces three different princesses for Lord Farquaad to choose from: Cinderella, Snow White, and Princess Fiona; at the suggestion from his henchman, Thelonious, Farquaad chooses Princess Fiona, who is currently trapped in a castle surrounded by lava and guarded by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. Accepting this as a task, Farquaad decides to marry her to become king, and rushes out to plan a raffle to see which knight would be worthy enough to embark on a quest to retrieve Fiona before the Mirror can tell him what happens to her at night. The Mirror then shows the audience the story of Fiona's childhood.A seven-year-old Fiona dreams of the brave knight who, as her storybooks tell her, will one day rescue her from her tower and end her mysterious curse with ""True Love's First Kiss"". As she grows into a teenager, and then a headstrong woman, she becomes a little bit stir-crazy, but she never loses her faith in her fairytales (""I Know It's Today"").Shrek and Donkey arrive in Duloc where Farquaad expresses his love for his kingdom, accompanied by his cheerful cookie-cut army of Duloc Dancers (""What's Up Duloc?""). They approach Farquaad, with him being impressed by Shrek's size and appearance. Farquaad demands that Shrek must rescue Fiona, and in return, he will give Shrek the deed to his swamp.The two unlikely friends set off to find Fiona, with Shrek becoming increasingly annoyed with Donkey as time progresses (""Travel Song""). After crossing the rickety old bridge and arriving at the castle, Shrek sets off alone to rescue Fiona while Donkey encounters Dragon who initially wants to eat him, but then decides to spare him by keeping him for herself after Donkey manages to charm her (""Donkey Pot Pie""). When Shrek finds Fiona, his lack of interest in playing out her desired, romantic rescue scene annoys her, and he drags her off by force (""This is How a Dream Comes True""). The two of them reunite with Donkey, and all three attempt to escape while being chased by the angry Dragon and her skeleton minions. Shrek traps Dragon and they get to a safe point.Fiona then insists that Shrek reveal his identity and is shocked that her rescuer is an ogre and not the Prince Charming her stories indicated. Shrek explains that he is merely her champion; instead, she is to marry Farquaad. The trio begin their journey back to Duloc, but Fiona becomes apprehensive as the sun begins to set. She insists that they rest for the night and that she spend the night alone in a nearby cave. Donkey and Shrek remain awake, with Donkey asking Shrek who he would be, if he did not have to be an ogre anymore. As Shrek opens up to Donkey on who he would wish to be, Fiona transforms into an ogress as part of her curse that happens during sunset, stands apart, alone, and listens (""Who I'd Be""). Act II The next day, Princess Fiona rises early and sings with a bluebird and dances with a deer (before making the bird explode and throwing the deer off a cliff). She assists the Pied Piper in his rat-charming duties (""Morning Person""). Shrek brings down her mood by attempting to give subtle hints about her groom-to-be (""Men of Farquaad's stature are in short supply"", ""He's very good at small talk"", etc.) and mocking her tragic childhood circumstances. The two begin a contest of trying to one-up each other to outdo the others' backstory, but end up revealing their respective pasts (""I Think I Got You Beat""). Both admit to being thrown out by their parents; this connection, as well as bonding over a love of disgusting bodily noises, kindles friendship. Back in Duloc, Lord Farquaad was in his bathtub planning his wedding, and he reveals his own sordid heritage after The Magic Mirror insists that Farquaad should invite his father, but Farquaad refuses, explaining how he abandoned him in the woods as a child (""The Ballad of Farquaad"").As Shrek and Fiona's newfound camaraderie grows into love, Donkey insists, with the help of the Three Blind Mice from his imagination, that Shrek should gather his courage and romantically engage Fiona (""Make a Move""). Shrek, finally beginning to come out of his caustic, protective shell, tries to find the words to explain his feelings to Fiona (""When Words Fail"").While Shrek is out finding a flower for Fiona, Donkey discovers that Fiona turns into an ogress at night, and she confesses that she was cursed as a child, which is why she was locked away in the tower. Only a kiss from her true love will return her to her proper form, and she asks Donkey to promise never to tell. Shrek arrives near the end of the conversation and misunderstands Fiona's description of herself as an ugly beast, and thinks she is talking about him. Hurt by her presumed opinion, Shrek storms off. The next day, transformed back to her human form, Fiona decides to tell Shrek about her curse (""Morning Person (Reprise)""). When she tries to explain, Shrek rebuffs her with his ""ugly beast"" overhearing, causing Fiona in turn to misunderstand. Then Farquaad arrives to claim Fiona and tells Shrek he has cleared the swamp of the Fairytale Creatures, and now belongs to Shrek again. While not very impressed with Farquaad, Fiona agrees to marry him and insists that they have the wedding before sunset. As Farquaad and Fiona ride back to Duloc, Donkey tries to explain the misunderstanding to Shrek (who is too angry and upset to listen), and Shrek rejects him as well, declaring that he will return to his swamp alone and build a wall to shield himself from the world (""Build a Wall"").Meanwhile, the Fairytale Creatures are on their way to a landfill which is to be their new home, since they were forced to relocate from the swamp. After dealing with the fact that Shrek broke his promise to them, however, Gingy rants that Farquaad's treatment of them is intolerable; just because they are freaks does not mean they deserve to be hated, so he rallies most of the other fairytale creatures into staging a coup d'état against Farquaad's rule. Unfortunately, a bitter Pinocchio (remembering they are not allowed back to Duloc), doesn't want his friends to get killed, suggesting they should just keep going, and wait until everything gets better, all the while, wishing to be a real boy. Exasperated by Pinocchio's turndown, Gingy convinces him to join the protest, inspiring him to accept who he is, as all of them have accepted who they are; they gather new confidence and strength in themselves, as they declare that they'll raise their ""Freak Flag"" high against their tormentors (""Freak Flag""). Now realizing that they have become something more than friends, and have become a family, Pinocchio now leads his gang back to Duloc to overthrow Farquaad once and for all.Shrek has returned to his once again private swamp, but he misses Fiona. Donkey shows up attempting to seal off his half of the swamp with stone boulders, which Shrek rebuffs. In turn, Donkey angrily berates Shrek for his reclusive and stubborn habits, even to the point of driving off Fiona. An angered Shrek reveals he heard her talking about a hideous creature the night before, and Donkey retorts that they were not talking about him, but of ""someone else"". When a confused Shrek inquires who it was, Donkey, wanting to keep his promise, and still crossed with Shrek, refuses to talk. When Shrek apologizes and extends his friendship, Donkey forgives him. The two then go back to Duloc, where Shrek objects to this marriage before Farquaad can kiss Fiona, and Fiona convinces him to let Shrek speak with her. Shrek finally finds the words to express his feelings for Fiona, and he declares his love for her (""Big Bright Beautiful World (Reprise)""). However, his declaration of love is mocked by Farquaad. Caught between love and her desire to break the curse, Fiona tries to escape the event. Just then, the Fairytale Creatures storm into the wedding and protest their banishment. They are also accompanied by Grumpy, one of the Seven Dwarfs, who reveals that he is Farquaad's father, and he kicked Farquaad out at the age of 28 when he wouldn't move out of the basement, revealing Farquaad is a freak as well. During the scuffle, the sun sets, causing Fiona to turn into an ogress in front of everyone. Farquaad, furious and disgusted over the change, orders for Shrek to be drawn and quartered along with the Fairytale Creatures and Fiona banished back to her tower. As Farquaad proclaims himself the new King, Shrek whistles for the Dragon, who has now escaped the castle (and is the reason Shrek and Donkey got to the wedding just in time). Dragon then crashes through the window with Donkey and incinerates Farquaad with her fiery breath.With Farquaad dead, Shrek and Fiona admit their love for each other and share true love's first kiss. Fiona's curse is broken, and she takes her true form: an ogress. At first, she is ashamed of her looks, but Shrek declares that she is still beautiful. The two ogres begin a new life together (along with Donkey, Dragon, and the Fairytale Creatures) as everyone celebrates their liberation against Farquaad's rule (""This Is Our Story""). In the end, Shrek and Fiona (in association with Donkey and Dragon) host their post-wedding party (""I'm A Believer"").","In the center of the story is an ogre named Shrek. When he was 7 years old, the parents deprived him home and left alone face to face with the cruel world. They warned their son that because of his intimidating appearance, he would always be hated by ordinary people, and unlikely ever would find happiness. Further events taking place in the present time. Embittered on others, Shrek lives a lonely life in the swamp. But once his rest was broken by crowd of fantasy creatures, claiming that from this point on, all the land in the district, including the ogre’s property is owned by them. All this takes place on the orders of one man – Lord Farquaad. Shrek goes on a journey to re-establish his private life and property. On the way, the main character reluctantly rescues Donkey from thugs. Last one, feeling that the ogre can protect him, is tied after him.  At the same time, Lord Farquaad tortures Gingerbread Man, to find out the whereabouts of the remaining fairytale creatures, which are hidden by a fairy. Then the villain learns that technically he cannot be regarded as a king, unless he marries a princess. And a suitable female candidate for this position, Princess Fiona, is imprisoned in the tower and a mysterious curse is imposed on her. According to the Mirror, the curse is exhibited only after sunset. Princess is alone since childhood, but do not lose faith that once a handsome prince will come to rescue her.  Shrek and Donkey arrive at Duloc and follow to the palace of Farquaad. On the way, the main characters destroy a competition designed to select the most worthy candidate for the position of a hero who can save Princess Fiona from the tower and bring her into the kingdom. This will do Farquaad a legitimate ruler of these lands. Shrek impresses Lord for his strength, size and aggression. In addition, Farquaad sees in him a one-time cutthroat, who, in exchange for unnecessary marsh, will take the implementation of unrealistic objective. And so it happens.  Shrek and Donkey are sent to search for Fiona. On the way, the main characters see a lot of strange things and colorful characters, including Puss In Boots. Coming close to the fortress, where the Princess is, Shrek is developing a plan of her salvation. Donkey acts as a distraction factor for a fire-breathing Dragon. Without even wanting to, Donkey charms the dangerous creature with one of his amulets. It is in this moment Shrek manages to get close to Fiona. Having read books about heroic rescue, Princess wants romance, but the savior has neither time nor the inclination for that. He brings her out of the castle using force, along the way escaping from the raging fire-breathing dragon. Once in safety, instead of the classic ‘thanks’, Princess insists that the hero revealed his identity from under the helmet. She was very upset when she found out that she was rescued by a man-eater, not the prince as it was written in the folio. Shrek explains that he was only a mercenary, and she is destined to marry Lord Farquaad. As the trio begins to return home, Fiona tries to avoid moonlight and asks her rescuers to travel only during the day light. This is due to the fact that because of the curse, Princess at night turns into an ogre, just like her savior. This discovery radically changes Shrek’s views on the situation. And his desire to return to his remote marsh as quickly as possible fades into the background. In the finale, Princess Fiona turns into ogre and stays with Shrek."
The Full Monty," While relocated to Buffalo, New York, the musical closely follows the film. Act I In depressed Buffalo, New York, the once-successful steel mills have grown brown with rust, rolling equipment has been removed, and the lines are silent. Best friends Jerry Lukowski and Dave Bukatinsky, along with the other unemployed mill workers, collect unemployment checks and ponder their lost lives, describing themselves as ""Scrap"". Elsewhere, Dave's wife Georgie and her friends are celebrating a night on the town by attending a Chippendales performance.  With their newfound independence and wealth as the sole earners of their families, they declare ""It's a Woman's World"".While hiding in the bathroom of the strip club, Jerry and Dave hear how unhappy Georgie is over Dave's insecurities (in part because of his weight) and Pam, Jerry's ex-wife, laments the loss of her marriage and her plans to take court action against him for the child support payments that he's failed to make since losing his job. Compromising the situation further is Jerry's son, Nathan, who reluctantly spends time with him; he has grown tired of his father's seeming lack of motivation.After talking to the stripper in the Chippendales act, Jerry and Dave are intrigued by the women's willingness to pay for a striptease act. Jerry is convinced that his ship has finally come in: he decides to organize a similar act of his own, with the intent to earn enough money to pay for his child support obligations (""Man"").The first to join the act is gauche and lonely Malcolm, a security guard at the steel mill where Dave and Jerry once worked. Malcolm tries to commit suicide by asphyxiating himself in his car through carbon monoxide poisoning. Dave pulls him out, and Jerry and Dave discuss various methods to commit suicide, for example: ""A Big-Ass Rock"".  Malcolm ultimately joins in and with the reassurance of his new-found friends behind him, he joins the fledgling lineup. His rescue and inclusion in the group gives him a newly optimistic and confident outlook on life. He also starts to grow more independent from his domineering, invalid mother, Molly.Next on Dave and Jerry's list is their former foreman, the middle-class aspirant Harold Nichols, who is taking a ballroom dance class with his immaculately groomed wife, Vicki. While Harold explains that he has concealed his unemployment from his materialistic wife, Vicki blithely sings about her sweet ""Life with Harold"".  Dave and Jerry tell him of their scheme; with literally no options left, Harold agrees to be the act's choreographer.In a sequence of scenes, former co-workers perform strip-tease auditions. One of the auditionees is invited to sit down after he flunks; he declines, saying that his children are outside waiting 'in the car' and that 'this is no place for kids' before glancing over at Nathan before leaving. Other auditioners are, however, hired: Noah 'Horse' Simmons for his comprehensive dance knowledge (while overlooking evidence of advanced arthritis) and urban legend, that is, the ""Big Black Man""; and Ethan Girard, who longs to dance like Donald O'Connor in ""Singin' in the Rain"" and has a jaw-dropping, euphemism-inducing penis.  They are also joined by Jeanette Burmeister, a tough, seen-it-all showbiz musician who ""shows up, piano and all"" to accompany the boys' rehearsals.Elsewhere, Dave contemplates his weight and Harold contemplates Vicki's spending habits, commenting they ""Rule My World"". At the first rehearsal, Harold feels the men are hopeless, but Jerry fires them up, encouraging them to think of it not as dance, but as sports moves (Michael Jordan's Ball). Act II As the men practice, doubts continue to creep in about whether this is the best way to make some money, due to their individual insecurities over their appearances. Jeanette is particularly straightforward (""Jeanette's Showbiz Number"").Requiring a deposit at the club, Jerry tries to get seed money from Pam, which she denies.  Nathan eventually provides some college funds, and Jerry is moved by Nathan's growing belief in his father (""Breeze Off the River"").Later, as the men are rehearsing at Harold's house, they undress in front of each other for the first time, and have nightmare visions that the women of the town will find ""The Goods"" will be inadequate. They are interrupted by repossessors who are scared off by the scantily clad men; their mutual friendships continue to grow.During a dress rehearsal, the boys get literally caught with their pants down  wearing thongs, causing  Jerry, Horse, Harold, Jeanette, and Nathan to be brought into a police station. Malcolm and Ethan successfully escape, and fall into a homoerotic embrace after they climb through the window of Malcolm's house. They are interrupted by the sudden illness of Molly.After Pam tearfully picks up Nathan (""Man, reprise""), the men are approached on the street by local women acquaintances who have heard of their show. Jerry declares that their show will be better than the Chippendales dancers because they'll go ""the full monty""—strip all the way. Dave, meanwhile, quits less than a week before the show, deprecating himself as a 'fat bastard' whom no one would want to see in the nude—including his wife, Georgie.The boys are brought together at the funeral of Malcolm's mother, where he is joined by Ethan in subtly announcing their relationship—""You Walk with Me"".Their secret out, all seems lost for the members of Hot Metal—their ""stage name"". But Georgie and Vicki reconfirm their love for their husbands despite their failures (""You Rule My World, reprise""). It is also revealed the arrest publicity has spiked ticket sales.With not much left to lose, and a sold-out show, the men decide to go for it for one night, including Harold, who has finally gotten a job. Dave finds his confidence and joins the rest of the group, but Jerry has a last minute loss of his.  Nathan convinces him to go on and he joins the boys for the final performance. With the support of all the friends, family, and townspeople, the boys ""Let It Go!""","In a small provincial town in the State of New York, once successful steel manufacture was stopped and many workers have now lost their positions and hate to receive periodic unemployment cheques, allowing them to exist somehow.

The failed guy returns back to own children that were waiting for him in the car, and among those who have passed are even such, who has developing arthritis, but all take his style of dance as a skill, not as a sign of a disease. One of them is fatty little man who worries about his excessive weight and ugly look.  At the first rehearsal one is fired off, who was bringing the company in a decadent mood. Despite the exhortations of leaders in the bright future, in the course of the rest of the rehearsals, the cast picks up more and more doubts about the success of the show, since some individuals – almost all the participants – not sure of their outward appearance.  During the period of the main final rehearsal, at home of one of them, men for the first time undress in front of each other and are horrified by their unsightly appearance, losing faith in the upcoming success.

The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas," It is the late 1970s, and a brothel has been operating outside of fictional Gilbert, Texas (subbing for real locale La Grange) for more than a century. It is under the proprietorship of Miss Mona Stangley, having been left to her by the original owner.  While taking care of her girls, she is also on good terms with the local sheriff, Ed Earl Dodd.  When crusading television reporter Melvin P. Thorpe (based on real-life Houston news personality Marvin Zindler) decides to make the illegal activity an issue, political ramifications cause the place to be closed down.","In the musical, we are talking about a brothel, whose history is for a hundred years, and it is controlled by the owner named Miss Mona Stangley, which is very concerned about her girls working there. The previous owner had left her this institution. About the reasons for this reckless act, it is not specified during the course of the story.  Of course, such activities cannot be without “protection” and the local sheriff Ed Earl Dodd actively operates on this, who is having strong business relations with the owner. Even his name as if drawing a picture in our heads of a brainless fat fellow, whose mind only filled with lust, but he certainly visits church and maybe even married.  The town, in which the events unfold, is unremarkable and is located in Texas. Has made-up name Gilbert, seemed to symbolize its provinciality. It, however, has the underlying real name – a town called La Grange, which is also located in Texas. The information regarding the availability of real twins does not end with this. Next, we meet a journalist named Melvin P. Thorpe, who also existed in the reality and was named as Marvin Zindler, from Houston, which was engaged in news and madly loved to dig out all sorts of interesting stories. So, this sneak learns somehow about the presence of the brothel and arrives to the city to conduct an independent journalistic investigation. Of course, the sheriff, and the owner of the brothel try to bribe him, to persuade him not to do it, but the events unfold in such a way that he publishes an article with an investigation, in the newspaper.  The effects of his work are far-reaching and the brothel is shut down, because of political disturbances. The musical, however, does not contain the prerequisites ensuring that it will not operate again after everything settles."
pajama game," Act IA strike is imminent at the Sleep-Tite Pajama Factory, where the workers churn out pajamas at a backbreaking pace (""Racing with the Clock"").

The union, led by Prez, is seeking a wage raise of seven-and-a-half cents an hour. Sid and Babe are in opposite camps, yet romantic interest is sparked at their first encounter. Despite cajoling from her fellow garment workers, Babe appears to reject Sid (""I'm Not At All in Love"").

Eventually the walls come down between the two, who admit their love for one another (""There Once Was a Man""), but their estrangement is reinforced when they return to the factory. A slow-down is staged by the union, strongly supported by Babe (""Racing with the Clock (Reprise)""). Sid, as factory superintendent, demands an ""honest day's work"" and threatens to fire slackers.

Despite her feelings for Sid, she pushes him away (""Hey There (Reprise)"").Back at the factory, the girls reassure Hines, who is personally offended by the slow down (""Think of the Time I Save""). Sid, now convinced that Babe's championship of the union is justified, takes Gladys out for the evening to a night club, ""Hernando's Hideaway"" (Hernando's Hideaway), where he wheedles the key to the company's books from her. Hines and Babe each discover the pair and assume they are becoming romantically involved. Babe storms out, and Hines believes his jealous imaginings have come true (""I'll Never Be Jealous Again Ballet"").Using Gladys' key, Sid accesses the firm's books and discovers that the boss, Hasler, has already tacked on the extra seven and one-half cents to the production cost, but has kept all the extra profits for himself.In Gladys' office, Hines, still jealous out of his mind, flings knives past Sid and Gladys (deliberately missing, he claims), narrowly missing an increasingly paranoid Mr. Hasler. After detaining Hines, Sid then brings about Hasler's consent to a pay raise and rushes to bring the news to the Union Rally, already in progress (""7½ Cents""). This news brings peace to the factory and to his love life, allowing him to reconnect with Babe (""There Once Was a Man (Reprise)""). Everyone goes out to celebrate—at Hernando's Hideaway (""Pajama Game"").", 
Big River,"  Act One In pre-Civil War Missouri, near St. Petersburg, the vagabond child Huckleberry Finn describes the events by which he and Tom Sawyer had discovered a fortune. Huck has been adopted by the Widow Douglas and her spinster sister Miss Watson, and his guardians, Judge Thatcher, Huck's best friend Tom Sawyer, and practically the entire town inform Huck that he needs to learn to read and write and read the Bible if he ever hopes to go to Heaven (""Do Ya Wanna Go To Heaven?""). The only one who does not attempt to pass judgment on Huck is Miss Watson's slave, Jim, who predicts that he will lead a life of ""considerable trouble and considerable joy"". Exasperated with the constraints on his daily life, Huck escapes his bedtime and steals away to Tom Sawyer's ""hideout"", an old cave. In the cave, Tom, Huck and a group of their friends plan to form a band of robbers who will rampage around the countryside (""The Boys"").Huck, on his way home, thinks about the confines of his life and his wish that he will find meaning in his life. (""Waitin' For the Light To Shine"") Huck returns home in the darkness to find his Pap, a violent drunk, waiting for him, who drags him off to his cabin in the woods. In his drunkenness, Pap swings from tomfoolery to extreme violence as he rails against a government that would take his son (and his son's money) away from him (""Guv'ment""). Pap attempts to kill Huck, hallucinating that he is the Angel of Death, but passes out in an inebriated mess.  The next day Pap goes off to trade and Huck takes the opportunity to escape. He kills a pig and scatters the blood and gore around the cabin in an effort to make it appear as if he's been murdered. Huck reflects that this is just the sort of thing Tom Sawyer would do, and Tom appears to sing a vaudeville-style turn about the usefulness of hogs (""Hand For the Hog"").Huck flees to the nearby Jackson's Island, where he, alone, asserts his self-assurance (""I, Huckleberry, Me""). But Huck is not alone; Miss Watson's slave, Jim, is there as well. He has run away to avoid being sold down the River to New Orleans. Despite his unease with the concept of abolitionism Huck offers to help Jim reach freedom in the North. A posse is after Jim: with only moments to spare, they find a raft and get it afloat in the mighty Mississippi River (""Muddy Water"").Jim and Huck travel only at night and don't get far from Jackson's Island before they are reminded of the seriousness of their actions: a boat carrying runaway slaves back to their masters passes them in the night (""The Crossing""). The days are long as the two forge their way down the river.  They pass a flooded house, and a dead man floating in the water that Jim will not let Huck look at. As they sing of the beauty of the River (""River In the Rain"") in a fog, they sail past the mouth of the Ohio — their path to freedom. Soon after, they pick up two drifters who commandeer the small raft as they escape the latest mob on their tail. The con men claim to be a Duke and a King, the long lost heirs to the Duchy of Bridgewater and the French Throne. Huck is intrigued by the delinquent ""royals"". The King and the Duke commandeer the raft and plot to sell Jim back into slavery for their own profit, unbeknownst to Huck (""When the Sun Goes Down In the South""). Act Two Huck, Jim, the Duke, and the King wash ashore in Bricktown, Arkansas, and attempt to fleece the rubes they find. The Duke and King come up with a scheme to make money (""The Royal Nonesuch""), tricking the townspeople. By the end of the evening, Huck can appreciate a new way of life — the three are now several hundred dollars richer. When he returns to the raft, Huck plays a horrible trick on Jim by assuming the guise of a slave hunter. Unamused, Jim rebukes Huck for the first time. After some thought, Huck realizes that Jim, though a slave, is still a human being and deserves an apology (""Worlds Apart"").The King and Duke reappear to dragoon Huck into their next escapade. While Jim is, again, left alone with the raft, the three encounter a young fool on a dock, singing of his love of his home state (""Arkansas"").  Through no fault of his own, he tells the con men everything they need to know about a fortune to be inherited in the Wilkes family, and they crash the funeral as impostors to go about securing their riches (""How Blest We Are""). Huck — through it all a pure soul — sees that the beautiful and innocent Mary Jane Wilkes is being robbed of her rightful inheritance by these ""rapscallions"", and steals back her money from the King and the Duke as she mourns her father's coffin (""You Oughta Be Here With Me""). He quickly stuffs the gold into her father's coffin and hides behind it to avoid notice.When Mary Jane realizes what Huck has done, she asks that he remain with her and become her friend. For the first time in his life, he is moved by the actions of another (""Leavin's Not the Only Way To Go""), yet he realizes that he has made a promise to Jim: one that transcends mere friendship. Huck returns again to the raft and finds the Duke tarred and feathered: he has sold Jim back into slavery for a mere forty dollars. Feeling guilty about what he has done, Huck pens a letter to Miss Watson, telling her where she can find the runaway Jim. After a momentary reprieve, Huck ends up feeling worse than ever.  He tears up the letter and resolves to free Jim again, even if it means he will go to Hell (""Waiting For the Light To Shine"" (Reprise)).Huck visits Mr. Phelps, the farmer to whom Jim has been sold, and is shocked to discover that he has been mistaken for Tom Sawyer, the Phelps' nephew who is expected for a visit. Tom arrives later and is intercepted by Huck before he reaches the farm. Huck explains everything and Tom, delighted by the prospect for a grand adventure, decides to help Huck free Jim from his captors while pretending to be his own brother Sid. They find Jim imprisoned in a tiny cell and work to free him as he laments his desire to be free (""Free At Last""). Progress is slowed by Tom's insistence of making sure that the circumstances of the escape match the adventure novels he has read, which includes notifying Phelps of the escape by an anonymous letter. As they free Jim, Tom is shot in the leg. Jim sacrifices his freedom to ensure Tom gets a doctor, and is about to be locked up again when Tom admits that Miss Watson has died, freeing Jim in her will.Jim decides to continue his trek to the North so that he may buy his family out of slavery, and Huck decides to continue westwards to escape any attempts to ""civilize"" him.  They sit for a moment at the banks of the river, recalling their adventures together (""River In the Rain"" (Reprise)). Jim reveals to Huck that the body they saw in the water was the dead body of Huck's Pap. Jim leaves Huck alone for the last time, and Huck decides, ""It was like the fortune Jim predicted long ago: considerable trouble and considerable joy."" He begins his next journey (""Muddy Water"" (Reprise)).","This is another musical about Huckleberry Finn & Tom Sawyer. It describes a different story than in the musical named The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, where they were still children, and just met. Here they have significantly grown and made a gang together.  Times of pre-Civil War, the St. Petersburg town, Douglas widow has adopted Huck. Since all in the town are believers, so he is strongly recommended to study the Bible. Angered that everyone try to teach him how to live, Huck runs away to his cave, where he & Tom, and the company of their friends, the same daredevils, create together a gang of robbers, as they presume.  Someday Huck returns home in the dark and catches Pap (his dad), a local drunkard who was quite completely lush boozer and from his alcohol has hallucinogenic deliriums in which was trying to kill Huck, but knocks off. Huck escapes, feigning his own death. In the new place, where he had fled, he stumbles upon a runaway slave Jim, and together they found the raft on the river Mississippi and escape from abandoned past lives. They go besides the mouth of the Ohio, and this means their freedom. Along the way, they pick up the two prisoners, who are represented as monarchs and secretly from Huck decide to sell Jim into slavery. Some time later, the prisoners are revealed as simple scams. In one of the towns on the way, they deceive the local population for the sake of profit. Huck then plays a bad joke with Jim, as if there are slave hunters close and when latter learns about profanity, becomes scary mad at Huck. Last, nevertheless apologizes after some time, because Jim, though a slave, but above all, a person.  The two scoundrels get the knowledge that some family around here has a great heritage and lure it with cunning, presenting themselves as distant relatives. Huck could not stand aside this deception (mostly because he liked the pretty heiress that wept bitterly at the coffin of her father, who left a legacy), and steals money from cheaters, returning them to the girl. She asks him to stay with her, but he could not leave Jim. Going back to the raft, he discovers that Jim was sold back into slavery for $ 40 and decided to release him.  He goes to the new owners of Jim and discovers that his mistakenly taken as Tom Sawyer, which must soon visit them. He intercepts Tom on the way, telling him everything and they decide to release Jim. In the process, when Jim had already been released from the cell, Tom was shot in the leg and Jim promises that if the doctor arrives here, he agrees to become a slave again. Tom says that Jim is no longer a slave, because his past mistress in his will released him before her death.  Jim decides that he will float on the river to buy his family out of slavery. Huck, remembering, through what adventures they went through, decides to sail with him further, towards new adventures."
Bandstand,"  Act I Newly back from the front lines, the young vet, pianist, and singer/songwriter Donny Novitski returns home from the war to Cleveland, Ohio in 1945, to find an America eager to get back to life (“Just Like It Was Before”). Unable to find a place in post-war Cleveland for himself, Donny hears of a National Radio Swing Band Competition in Tribute to the Troops, and hatches a plan to create a band composed entirely of fellow vets for a shot at instant fame and Hollywood fortune (“Donny Novitski”). With a statewide competition to win first, Donny puts his band together: Jimmy Campbell on saxophone and clarinet, Davy Zlatic on bass, Nick Radel on trumpet, Wayne Wright on trombone, and Johnny Simpson on drums (“I Know A Guy”). Each of the members of the band have struggled with the adjustment from military life to life at home, but they find friendship and commonality over this shared goal.Following their first performance (“Ain't We Proud”), Donny makes good on a promise to check in on Julia Trojan, the young widow of the man who had been his best friend in the war, Michael. Meanwhile, the vets in Donny’s new band try desperately to adjust to civilian life (“Proud Riff”). As Julia prepares to host Donny for dinner in the hope of learning more about her husband’s death, she confides in her mother, June Adams that she just wants to be who she was before her husband's death (“Who I Was”). During dinner, Donny avoids discussing the death of Julia’s husband. Later, haunted by the memories of war, the band members play their instruments, and Donny arrives at the church where Julia sings (“Counterpoint/Pie Jesu”). Impressed by her voice, Donny invites Julia to hear the band he’s put together. Excitedly, Julia’s mother hopes that all will soon be “Just Like It Was Before (Reprise)”.At the club, Donny invites Julia to sing a standard with the Band (“First Steps First”). After the performance, Donny convinces a hesitant Julia to join the band, and they begin rehearsing in earnest (“Breathe”) for their first gig together, trying out a new tune, “You Deserve It”. When Donny’s confidence in winning the competition falters, Julia offers him a journal of poems she has written. Inspired by Julia's take on post-war life, Donny composes a melody for one of her poems that he is convinced will win them the preliminary in Ohio which guarantees them a slot on the final broadcast in New York City. The Ohio broadcast is in full swing (“Dwight Anson & Jean Ann”), as the Donny Nova Band featuring Julia Trojan takes the stage with “Love Will Come And Find Me Again”. The band wins the state preliminary, but are told they have to pay their own way to New York and are required to compete in a second round of elimination to secure their spot in the final broadcast. From disbelief and despair, Donny rallies his band of brothers with a vision of a world where they are recognized for their sacrifices and talents (“Right This Way”). Act II With renewed determination that “Nobody” tells them ‘no’, the Band begins playing every available club in Cleveland. Their growing number of fans celebrate that “The Boys Are Back”. Julia and Donny continue their songwriting collaboration with “I Got A Theory” about Cleveland itself, raising more money and hometown support. With the New York trip imminent, and the bond between them growing stronger, Julia presses Donny for the truth of her husband’s death in battle. Horrified by the revelation that Donny accidentally caused Michael's death in a friendly fire incident, Julia abandons the Band. After expressing her feelings to her mother, June tells Julia that sometimes “Everything Happens” without reason or fault. After deep reflection, Julia returns to Donny with a new poem as an apology, which paints a raw and truthful portrait of Donny and the Band members: Johnny was severely injured and suffers from chronic pain, amnesia, and cognitive issues; Nick was a prisoner of war, giving him anger and trust issues; Davy liberated Dachau and has turned to alcohol and humor to cope with the memories; Wayne suffers from mental illness (likely OCD), meaning his children no longer recognize him and his marriage breaks down; Jimmy focuses on his law studies to avoid letting anybody in after terrible loss; Donny is an insomniac who is experiencing survivor's guilt after the death of Michael, Julia's husband. Inspired, Donny sets Julia’s new poem to music, but both of them realize that the lyrics must be rewritten if the song is ever to be performed in public; they turn it into a love song about a girl and her returning soldier (“Welcome Home”).After having received a generous donation from their hometown fans, the Band sets off to live their dream of being “A Band In New York City”. After a magical first night in New York, Donny and Julia find themselves outside her hotel room door, finally admitting their true feelings for one another (“This Is Life”). Backstage at the final broadcast, moments before their appearance, the band realizes that the fine print of the contract they’ve signed is a trap, and the promised prize a sham. Refusing to allow their military service to be sentimentalized and exploited by the contest promoters, and unwilling to give away the rights to his song, Donny convinces the Band to make the riskiest choice of all, and fight for themselves, and he and Julia kiss. (“This Is Life (Reprise)”). Live on air for the entire country to hear, the Band stages a virtual coup d’état of the broadcast as Julia sings every brutally honest word of her original poem (“Welcome Home (Finale)”).In an “Epilogue”, a year later, the Donny Nova Band featuring Julia Trojan find themselves to be celebrated stars, with sold-out New York concerts and a nationwide tour.","In 1945, as America’s soldiers come home to ticker-tape parades and overjoyed families, Private First Class Donny Novitski, singer and songwriter, returns to rebuild his life with only the shirt on his back and a dream in his heart. When NBC announces a national competition to find the nation’s next great musical superstars, Donny joins forces with a motley group of fellow veterans, each an astonishing musician. Together, they form a band unlike any the nation has ever seen. Along the way, they discover the power of music to face the impossible, find their voice and finally feel like they have a place to call home."
Rock of Ages,"  Act I Lonny Barnett, who serves as the show's narrator, sets up the story: In 1987, an aspiring rocker named Drew Boley works as a busboy in the Hollywood bar/club called the Bourbon Room, owned by Dennis Dupree and assisted by Lonny (""Just Like Paradise/Nothin' But a Good Time"").

Grudgingly, Sherrie accepts Justice's offer to work in her club (""Harden My Heart/Shadows of the Night""). As the act closes, everyone is alone – Drew, as an upcoming rock star; Sherrie, fending for herself as an exotic dancer; Regina protesting the redevelopment; and Dennis, trying to save his club (""Here I Go Again"").

After being forced to give him a lapdance, she beats him up while dancing (""I Hate Myself for Loving You/Heat of the Moment""). Drew arrives to admit his feelings to her, but becomes angry when he sees the two in a suggestive position and storms off. Justice later tells Drew that as soon as he left, Sherrie had punched Stacee in the jaw.Regina continues her protest against the destruction of the Strip, but yields no success. She convinces Franz to stand up to his father if he does not believe in his father's vision. Franz admits that he has his own dream, namely to open a confectioner's store in Germany. He rebels against his father and admits his love for Regina (""Hit Me with Your Best Shot""). Meanwhile, Dennis and Lonny, upset at the loss of The Bourbon Room, admit that they have feelings for each other (""Can't Fight This Feeling"").Sherrie decides to leave the Venus Club after the scene with Drew, and Justice tells her that she had a similar experience with her first love. Everyone is in turmoil as they attempt to move on with their lives (""Every Rose Has Its Thorn""). Franz leaves for Germany and Hertz begins to regret the hurtful way he treated his son (""Keep on Loving You""). Regina arrives and explains to Hertz that Franz does not hate him; he simply wants his father to support his dream. Hertz decides to return the deed to the Bourbon Room to Dennis and invest in Franz's confectionery store.Drew, now a pizza delivery boy, realizes none of his dreams have come true—he still is not a rock star, and Sherrie is leaving on a midnight train. Lonny arrives and breaks the  fourth wall by explaining to Drew that his life is so miserable because they are all characters in a musical and that it was their book writer who made it so. He also reveals to Drew that he serves as the show's ""dramatic conjurer"" and that if Drew wants a happy ending, it is up to him to get the girl. After hearing this, Drew realizes that he does not need fame to make him happy, only Sherrie (""Oh Sherrie"").

Dennis passes away, leaving the Bourbon Room to Lonny, and Sherrie and Drew move to Glendale and start a family.

Iris apologizes and confesses that she is not really rich, but scared and they share a kiss.At lunch, Carmen, a self-assured, cocky Latina spitfire, asks Mr. Myers if she can skip class on Friday to audition for West Side Story. He tells her that it would just be another role for her to hide behind. Carmen, enraged, dreams of seeing her name in lights and people gasping as she walks down the street (""There She Goes/Fame!""). The other students join in her fantasy and begin an exciting, electrifying dance.Serena and Nick are rehearsing another scene and Serena confesses that she wants to try something romantic and passionate.  Serena is in love with Nick, but Nick is mainly focused on acting. Serena laments her unrequited love (""Let's Play a Love Scene""). Afterwards, Carmen interrupts Schlomo while he practices his violin, giving him lyrics that she wrote for the melody he always plays. Schlomo tries them out, and changes some of the lyrics with Carmen (""Bring on Tomorrow""), which results in Carmen joining the band. Carmen kisses Schlomo and leaves. Goody (also in the band, along with Lambchops) makes fun of Schlomo afterwards. In the hallway, Miss Sherman talks to Tyrone about his care-free attitude towards education. She threatens to keep him out of the Fall Festival if his grades don't improve.  Miss Bell overhears and argues that Tyrone's artistic endeavors are more important than his academic performance (""The Teachers' Argument""). Tyrone storms off, threatening to drop out of school, and Miss Sherman reminds the gathered crowd of students of their academic commitments (""Hard Work (Reprise)"").Act IIThe students begin their junior year with the P.A. Fall Festival (""The Junior Festival"").At a dance rehearsal, Mabel, an overweight dancer, complains about retaining water, and other problems she faces with the size of her body. She confesses that, although she tries many weight-loss schemes and diets, she always goes back to the ""Seafood Diet: I see food, and then I eat it!"" She prays aloud for God's help in keeping her from becoming ""the world's fattest dancer"" (""Mabel's Prayer""), eventually having an epiphany and deciding to switch her major to acting. Later, Nick congratulates Serena for getting the lead female role of Juliet in their junior show, Romeo and Juliet.  Serena gets excited and assumes that Nick got the role of Romeo.  However, she is surprised to learn that Joe Vegas has the role of Romeo and Nick got the part of Mercutio. Lambchops suggests that Nick is gay, and when Serena confronts him about it, Nick angrily replies that he is straight. Serena is so angry she decides to channel it into her acting (""Think of Meryl Streep""). Carmen tells Schlomo of her plan to leave school and go to Los Angeles.  She has met a Hollywood agent named Elliot Greene, who is sending her a plane ticket. Schlomo begs her not to go. He had seen her getting into Elliot's limousine and accuses her of using cocaine with him. Schlomo tells Carmen he loves her, but is left alone with his violin/flute/keyboard (depending on what the actor can actually play).In English class, Tyrone is reading a Superman comic book.  Miss Sherman catches him, and forces him to stand up in front of the class and read from the comic book.  He accuses her of trying to make him look stupid.  He then accuses her of racism. Miss Sherman slaps him in the face and, shocked by what she has done, runs off.  Tyrone says to his classmates he doesn't need her help, or the ability to read or write - he is a dancer, and that's all he needs (“Dancin’ on the Sidewalk.”). Miss Sherman returns and apologises for her outburst. She reveals that she believes Tyrone may have dyslexia and offers him extra help, to which Tyrone refuses and storms off. Miss Sherman pleads after him not to give up on her (“These Are My Children”).The students rehearse Romeo and Juliet. Joe, insecure playing Romeo, has been ad-libbing.

They dance a pas de deux and walk off together, hand in hand.Carmen is standing in front of the school looking physically wasted and disoriented.  She spots Schlomo and tells him the truth about her experiences in Hollywood (""In L.A."").  Carmen promises him that she will quit the drugs and get her GED. He gives her a couple of dollars and sadly departs, reminding Carmen that he will always love her.At the farewell party, everyone is dressed up and the celebration is loud and festive. Nick confesses his feelings to Serena and they decided to try to date although they are heading to different colleges (""Let's Play a Love Scene (Reprise)""). Schlomo reveals through monologue that Carmen has died of a drug overdose, and dedicates the classes' final senior song to her memory (""Bring On Tomorrow (Reprise)"").After the bows, Carmen comes back dancing on the roof of a taxi cab and sings ""Fame"" for the Finale.","The story begins and the viewers see a very motley group of energetic young people of different ethnic and social strata, gathered in a classroom for auditing to enroll in the study at the School of Performing Arts.

Passion," The musical is usually presented in one act. An intermission was added only for the London production. Act I In Milan in 1863, two lovers are at the height of ecstasy (""Happiness""). The handsome captain, Giorgio, breaks their reverie by telling Clara that he is being transferred to a provincial military outpost. In the next scene, Giorgio is in the mess hall at the army camp with Colonel Ricci, the unit's commanding officer, and Dr. Tambourri, its physician. He thinks longingly of Clara (“First Letter”) and she thinks longingly of him (""Second Letter""). Giorgio's thoughts are interrupted by a bloodcurdling scream. The Colonel tells him not to worry; it's just Fosca, his sick cousin. Giorgio offers to lend her some of his books.As he begins to adjust to the tedium of life at the outpost, the sensitive Giorgio feels increasingly out of place amongst the other men (""Third Letter""). He starts becoming friendly with the Doctor, who describes Fosca as having a nervous disorder. She frequently collapses into seizures, exposing her suffering and need for connection.Fosca arrives after dinner to thank Giorgio for the books. When he suggests she keep a novel longer to meditate over it, she explains that she does not read to think or search for truth, but to live vicariously through the characters. She then goes off into a dark musing on her life (""I Read""). Giorgio awkwardly changes the subject, but when he observes a hearse pulling up, she is overtaken by a hysterical convulsion. Giorgio is stunned and appalled (""Transition"").The following afternoon, the Colonel, the Doctor, Giorgio and Fosca go for a walk together. As they stroll through a castle's neglected garden, Giorgio politely engages her in conversation while mentally narrating a letter to Clara. When Fosca confesses that she feels no hope in her life, he tells her that ""the only happiness that we can be certain of is love."" Fosca is hurt and embarrassed, but recognizes that Giorgio, like herself, is different from others, and asks for his friendship (""Garden Sequence"").Giorgio and Clara exchange letters about Fosca. Clara urges him to avoid her whenever possible. When Giorgio is preparing to take a five-day leave, Fosca shows up unexpectedly, dissolving into hysteria and begging him to return soon. Fosca is next seen reading, stone-faced, from a letter Giorgio has sent rejecting her feelings as he and Clara make love (""Trio"").Upon Giorgio's return, Fosca reproaches him. She demands to know about his affair and learns that Clara is married. In a sharp exchange, they agree to sever all ties. Weeks go by with no contact between them, but just as he is beginning to think that he is finally free of Fosca, he is informed by the Doctor that she is dying. His rejection of her love has exacerbated her illness. Giorgio, whose job as a soldier is to save lives, must go and visit her sickbed. He reluctantly agrees.He enters Fosca's chamber, and she implores him to lie beside her while she sleeps. At daybreak, Fosca asks him for a favor before he leaves: ""Write a letter for me."" He complies, but the letter she imagines is a fantasy one from Giorgio to herself (“I Wish I Could Forget You”). She is seized by another convulsive attack, and he hastens from the room. Act II The soldiers gossip about Giorgio and Fosca while playing pool (""Soldiers' Gossip""). The Colonel thanks Giorgio for the kindness he has shown his cousin and explains her history. As a child, Fosca was doted on by her parents and once had illusions about her looks. When she was seventeen, the Colonel introduced her to an Austrian count named Ludovic. Fosca was taken with him, though she had her reservations. Once they were married, Ludovic took all of her family's money. Fosca eventually discovered that he had another wife and a child. When confronted, he smoothly admitted to his deception and vanished. It was then that Fosca first became ill. After her parents died, she went to live with the Colonel, who felt responsible for her circumstances (""Flashback"").Meanwhile, Clara has written Giorgio a letter (""Sunrise Letter"") addressing her approaching age, in which she admits her fear of losing love when she is old and no longer beautiful. Giorgio makes his way to a desolate mountain and is in the midst of reading when Fosca appears. After Giorgio lashes out at her in anger (""Is This What You Call Love?""), she crumples and faints. He picks her up and carries her back in the rain.The rain, the ordeal of getting Fosca back to camp and perhaps exposure to her contagious emotions have conspired to give Giorgio a fever. He falls into a slumber and dreams that Fosca is dragging him down into the grave (""Nightmare""). The Doctor sends him off to Milan on sick leave (""Forty Days""). As he boards the train, he is followed once again by Fosca. She apologizes for everything and promises to keep her distance for good. Giorgio pleads with her to give him up. She explains that this cannot happen. Her love is not a choice, it is who she is, and she would gladly die for him (""Loving You""). Giorgio is finally moved by the force of her emotions. He takes her back to the outpost (""Transition"").The Doctor warns Giorgio that he must stop seeing Fosca, that she threatens his mental and physical health. Giorgio requests to forgo his leave; he feels it his duty to stay and help her as much as he can. Back in Milan, Clara questions him jealously about Fosca. Giorgio asks Clara to leave her husband and start a new life with him, but as she has a child, she cannot.During Christmas, Giorgio is told that he has been transferred back to military headquarters. Later on, he reads Clara's newest letter, in which she asks him to wait until her son is grown before planning a more serious commitment (""Farewell Letter""). Giorgio finds he no longer desires the carefully arranged, convenient affair that they shared (""Just Another Love Story"").Having discovered the letter Fosca dictated, the Colonel accuses Giorgio of leading her on and demands a duel. The Doctor attempts to mediate the two, but Giorgio insists on seeing her again. He realizes that he loves Fosca, for no one has ever truly loved him but her. That evening, he returns to Fosca's room, knowing that the physical act might very well kill her (“No One Has Ever Loved Me”). They embrace, their passion consummated at last.The duel takes place the following morning behind the castle. Giorgio shoots at the Colonel and lets out a shrill howl eerily reminiscent of Fosca's earlier outbursts.Months later, Giorgio is in a hospital, dazed, recovering from a nervous breakdown. He is told that Fosca died shortly after their night together; the Colonel recovered from the wound. Dreamlike, the other characters in the story reappear as Giorgio begins reading from Fosca's last letter. Gradually her voice joins his, and together they look back on their revelations (""Finale"").The company walks off, Fosca last, leaving Giorgio alone at his table.","1863, Milan city. Captain Giorgio Bachetti told his lover about his appointment in the new regiment. Arriving there, a man met with local Colonel in charge & Dr. Tambourri.

He had recovered from the wounds he received on a duel. Giorgio began reading this letter by Fosca."
The Band's Visit," In 1996, the Alexandria Ceremonial Police Orchestra, just arrived in Israel, are waiting in Tel Aviv's central bus station. They expect to be welcomed by a representative from a local Arab cultural organization, but no one shows up. The group's leader, the quiet Colonel Tewfiq Zakaria, eventually decides the group will take the bus and instructs the younger, adventurous officer, Haled, to purchase the group's bus tickets. At the ticket office, Haled asks the clerk for a ticket to the city of Petah Tikvah, but due to his Egyptian accent, she misunderstands him and sells him tickets to the isolated desert town of ""Bet Hatikva"".The scene shifts to Bet Hatikva, where the residents bemoan the boring and monotonous lives they lead in the desert (""Waiting""). When the band arrives in Bet Hatikva, they approach two cafe workers, Papi and Itzik, to ask for directions to the Arab cultural centre for their performance the next day. Unsure who these men are and what they're asking about, they get the café's owner, a charismatic woman named Dina. Tewfiq again asks for directions to the cultural centre before Dina realizes they think this is Petah Tikvah, and explains that this is the wrong place, and they must have taken the wrong bus (""Welcome to Nowhere""). Dina tells the group that the next bus does not arrive until the next day. One of the band members looks for a phone to contact the Egyptian embassy, but Dina tells him that the only pay phone in town is guarded over, every night, by a man who obsessively waits for his girlfriend to call him, even though it has been months. Dina offers the band a meal and a place to stay for the night, and Tewfiq reluctantly agrees. In her kitchen, Tewfiq asks her about her background, and she tells how she was once married, and nothing in real life went as she had idealistically and naively thought (""It Is What It Is""). She asks Tewfiq the same, and he tells of a wife and son in Egypt.Meanwhile, Itzik allows the band member Simon to stay with him, his wife, their baby, and his father-in-law, Avrum. During dinner, Simon asks what happened to Avrum's wife, and Avrum says she died. When Simon asks when she died, he is silenced; Avrum says it is healthy for him to talk about it. He tells the story of how he met his wife many years ago at a club and remembers how music had been the foundation for their entire relationship. Itzik and Simon are touched by the story, but Itzik's wife continues to eat silently, avoiding all interaction during the meal (""The Beat of Your Heart"").That night, everyone makes plans to go out. Papi is invited on a double date with his crush but suffers from anxiety about going out with her. Haled tags along. Dina offers to show Tewfiq around Bet Hatikva, which he again is reluctant to accept. At dinner, Dina asks Tewfiq about what style of music his band plays. After he claims they stick to traditional Arab music, she mentions how as a child she would listen to music on Egyptian radio stations, from the likes of Umm Kulthum, and movies starring Omar Sharif. Tewfiq quotes one of the movies in question and they bond over the shared memories (""Omar Sharif"").At the roller skating rink, Haled watches from afar as Papi continues to ignore his crush and clumsily skate. After Papi defuses a brief altercation between Haled and one of the guards at the rink, Papi explains his romantic anxieties to Haled (""Papi Hears the Ocean""). After accidentally causing his crush to slip on her skates and fall down, Papi is petrified yet again. Haled helps to boost Papi's confidence, which leads to Papi and his crush finally embracing each other (""Haled's Song About Love"").After their dinner, Dina takes Tewfiq to ""The Park"", which is just a bench in the middle of Bet Hatikva. She asks him what it is like to have an orchestra and play music for people. He initially stutters, but after she asks him to sing, he begins to show her what it's like to be a conductor by allowing her to mimic his arm motions as he sings (“Itgara’a”). Despite not being able to understand his Arabic lyrics, she remains mesmerized by him and wonders if his visit to Bet Hatikva was meant for her by fate (""Something Different"").Itzik sings his son to sleep (""Itzik's Lullaby""), but in frustration with his lack of ambition in life, his wife leaves. Simon is initially concerned, but Itzik tells him that this happens often and she always returns. Soon, she does, and their son begins to cry. Simon is able to soothe the infant by playing his original concerto on his clarinet. Itzik and his wife reconcile, and Simon says goodbye to Avrum before going to bed.Dina finally asks more about Tewfiq's life. When she approaches the topic of his son, he reveals that he and his son never quite got along, which has bothered Tewfiq to this day and was the likely reason of his son's suicide. He also tells how his wife ended her life, as well, due to the heartbreak. Now visibly distraught, Tewfiq resists Dina's romantic advances as Haled arrives with news that the bus will be there in the morning to take them to Petah Tikvah. Tewfiq starts to leave the room, upset, while Dina solemnly recalls the meaning of their relationship (""Something Different (Reprise)""). Once Tewfiq is gone, Haled jokingly compliments her eyes, and she kisses him forcefully.Distraught, the 'telephone guy' questions his devotion to his loved one as he continues to wait by the pay phone. He and the citizens of Bet Hatikva long for the presence of a meaning to their lives as they anticipate the return to normalcy (""Answer Me""). Suddenly, just as 'telephone guy' gives up hope, the phone rings and he speaks to his girlfriend for the first time in months.The following morning, the band gathers by Dina's cafe before they prepare to board the next bus. As they begin to board, Dina hands Tewfiq a piece of paper with ""Petah Tikvah"" on it to ensure he doesn't forget. Later that day, the band makes it to the Petah Tikvah's Arab cultural centre. Once they are in their places, Tewfiq begins to conduct, and the stage cuts to black.","It is 1996, and through an error in pronunciation, the Alexandria Ceremonial Police Orchestra is stranded in the isolated desert town of Bet Havitka, Israel (rather than the city Petah Tikva, their actual destination). Without knowing the language and with very little money, the band members - led by conductor Tewfiq Zakaria - are welcomed by the locals, including cafe owner Dina and her two employees, Papi and Itzik. During this one night in a sleepy town where nothing much changes, the Egyptian band members and their Israeli hosts communicate in English (their only common language) and find their mutual love of music, whether traditional Middle Eastern ballads or American jazz and Chet Baker. Winner of ten Tony Awards and a score based in traditional middle eastern styles (with musicians planted all around the stage), The Band’s Visit appeals to the universal romance and passion people find in music, no matter where they are from."

Nine," Guido Contini, famous Italian film director, has turned forty and faces double crises: he has to shoot a film for which he can't write the script, and his wife of twenty years, the film star Luisa del Forno, may be about to leave him if he can't pay more attention to the marriage. As it turns out, it is the same crisis.Luisa's efforts to talk to him seem to be drowned out by voices in his head: voices of women in his life, speaking through the walls of his memory, insistent, flirtatious, irresistible, potent. Women speaking beyond words (Overture delle Donne). And these are the women Guido has loved, and from whom he has derived the entire vitality of a creative life, now as stalled as his marriage.In an attempt to find some peace and save the marriage, they go to a spa near Venice (Spa Music), where they are immediately hunted down by the press with intrusive questions about the marriage and—something Guido had not told Luisa about—his imminent film project (Not Since Chaplin).As Guido struggles to find a story for his film, he becomes increasingly preoccupied—his interior world sometimes becoming indistinguishable from the objective world (Guido's Song). His mistress Carla arrives in Venice, calling him from her lonely hotel room (A Call from the Vatican), his producer Liliane La Fleur, former vedette of the Folies Bergeres, insists he make a musical, an idea which itself veers off into a feminine fantasy of extraordinary vividness (The Script/Folies Bergeres). And all the while, Luisa watches, the resilience of her love being consumed by anxiety for him and a gathering dismay for their lives together (My Husband Makes Movies / Only With You).Guido's fugitive imagination, clutching at women like straws, eventually plunges through the floor of the present and into his own past where he encounters his mother, bathing a nine-year-old boy—the young Guido himself (Nine). The vision leads him to re-encounter a glorious moment on a beach with Saraghina, the prostitute and outcast to whom he went as a curious child, creeping out of his Catholic boarding school St. Sebastian, to ask her to tell him about love. Her answer, be yourself (Ti Voglio Bene / Be Italian), and the dance she taught him on the sand echoes down to the forty-year-old Guido as a talisman and a terrible reminder of the consequences of that night—punishment by the nuns and rejection by his appalled mother (The Bells of St. Sebastian). Unable to bear the incomprehensible dread of the adults, the little boy runs back to the beach to find nothing but the sand and the wind—an image of the vanishing nature of love, and the cause of Guido Contini's artistry and unanchored peril: a fugitive heart.Back into the present, Guido is on a beach once more. With him, Claudia Nardi, a film star, muse of his greatest successes, who has flown from Paris because he needs her, but this time she does not want the role. He cannot fathom the rejection. He is enraged. He fails to understand that Claudia loves him, too, but wants him to love her as a woman 'not a spirit'—and he realizes too late that this was the real reason that she came—in order to know, and now she does. He cannot love her that way. She is in some way released to love him for what he is, and never to hope for him again. Wryly she calls him ""My charming Casanova!"" thereby involuntarily giving Guido the very inspiration he needs and for which has always looked to her. As Claudia lets him go with ""Unusual Way,"" Guido grasps the last straw of all—a desperate, inspired movie—a 'spectacular in the vernacular'—set on ""The Grand Canal"" and cast with every woman in his life.The improvised movie is a spectacular collision between his real life and his creative one—a film that is as self-lacerating as it is cruel, during which Carla races onto the set to announce her divorce and her delight that they can be married only to be brutally rejected by Guido in his desperate fixation with the next set-up, and which climaxes with Luisa, appalled and moved by his use of their intimacy—and even her words—as a source for the film, finally detonating with sadness and rage. Guido keeps the cameras rolling, capturing a scene of utter desolation—the women he loves, and Luisa whom he loves above all, littered like smashed porcelain across the frame of his hopelessly beautiful failure of a film. ""Cut. Print!""The film is dead. The cast leaves. They all leave. Carla, with ""Simple""—words from the articulate broken heart, Claudia with a letter from Paris to say that she has married, and Luisa in a shattering exit from a marriage that has, as she says, been 'all of me' (Be On Your Own).Guido is alone. ""I Can't Make This Movie"" ascends into the scream of ""Guido out in space with no direction,' and he contemplates suicide. But, as the gun is at his head, there is a final life-saving interruption—from his nine-year-old self (Getting Tall), in which the young Guido points out it is time to move on. To grow up. And Guido surrenders the gun. As the women return in a reprise of the Overture (Reprises), but this time to let him go, only one is absent: Luisa. Guido feels the aching void left by the only woman he will ever love. In the 2003 Broadway production, as the boy led the women off into his own future to the strains of ""Be Italian"", Luisa steps into the room on the final note, and Guido turned toward her—this time ready to listen.","Guido Contini is a famous Italian film director. In the life of 40-year-old man occurred a crisis. He should make a movie, the screenplay for which have not been written yet. His 20-year-old wife Luisa required from director to pay more attention to their marriage. Otherwise, she promised to leave him. In the head of Guido were heard women’s voices from his past. They drowned out the words of Luisa. Thanks to the women, he made a successful career as a director, but now he has lost inspiration.  While at the resort, which is located near Venice, Guido and Luisa were trying to save their marriage. There they caught up with journalists who have been asking questions about the personal life of the director and his wife, as well as about the new film of Contini. Man was hiding from his wife that he started to work again, and now the mystery was unveiled. Restless Guido tried to find a subject for a picture. The inner world of man started to mix with reality. In Venice was the mistress of director Carla. The woman started to call Guido. At the same time with the man contacted his producer Liliane La Fleur. She offered to make a new film in the form of a musical. Luisa realized that her marriage with Guido could collapse at any time.  The rich imagination of director again took the images of his past women. The man plunged into the memories of the distant past. He saw his mother, who was washing a 9-year-old child – Guido himself. Director once again met Saraghina – prostitute and outcast – on the beach. After leaving the Catholic boarding school, he, being a curious boy, came to ask her what love is. The answer of woman was dancing, which she had shown on the sand – it accompanied Guido throughout his whole life. And then arose the terrible memories of the punishment in that night by the nuns. When the little boy ran back to the beach, there was no one – just sand and wind. Heart of Guido has experienced a strong hit.  Returning to the present, the director found himself on the beach. Next to him was the famous actress Claudia – she was the muse of Guido. The woman arrived from the French capital, as man needed her. When the director offered her a role in the film, the actress refused. First, Guido could not understand why this happened. Then the man realized that Claudia wanted reciprocity in love – she did not want to be only his muse. But the director could not respond to her feelings with what she wanted. Realizing this, the actress called him Casanova and pushed Guido upon the idea for his new film. She has recognized that the man should go his own way. Inspired, director decided to shoot a film about the women of his life.  In the picture, there was a collision of reality and the creative essence of the creator. In the film, Guido brutally pushed his mistress Carla, when she told him about her divorce – woman was hoping for a future marriage with the director. The man used the words of wife for the picture’s finale. His relationships with women were like shards of broken porcelain. The film was lost, and loving persons left Guido. Carla went with a heavy heart, Claudia sent a letter saying that she is married, Luisa filed for divorce. The man was left alone.  Realizing that he will not finish his film, the director thought about suicide. He was saved by image of a 9-year-old Guido, who would not allow the gun to fire. The boy said that a man must move on and rise above himself. After that, the director got rid of the weapon. There were women from the past, and only one of them was not in front of him – Luisa. Guido felt a void, since he really loved her. This woman's steps were heard in the room. Now the man was ready to talk to his beloved."

Gigi," Honoré Lachaille explains that in turn-of-the-20th-century Paris, marriage is not the only option. His nephew Gaston is a rich bon vivant, much like his uncle. But Gaston is bored with the high life and his series of mistresses. The one thing he truly enjoys is spending time with an old friend of his uncle, Madame Alvarez, whom he calls Mamita, and especially her granddaughter, the precocious, carefree Gilberte or ""Gigi"".  Gaston's Uncle Honoré was involved romantically with Mamita, although advancing age has confused their recollections of the past.Madame Alvarez sends Gigi to her Aunt Alicia's to learn to be a high-society courtesan in their family's tradition. Gigi is initially a very poor student, as she does not understand the reasons behind her education and finds Parisians' obsession with making love inexplicable. She does, however, enjoy spending time with Gaston, whom she treats as an older brother.  Alicia is unhappy to discover that Gaston took Gigi and Madame Alvarez on holiday, as her sister had not consulted her.  She insists that Gigi's education must increase dramatically if she is to catch a prize such as Gaston. Mamita is shocked, but sees the advantages it could bring Gigi and so goes along with the plan - though neither tells Gigi of their scheming. Gigi is miserable in her lessons, but puts up with them as a necessary evil, though she still seems awkward and bumbling to her perfectionist aunt.Gaston visits and is shocked to see Gigi in an alluring white gown. He tells her she looks ridiculous and storms out, but returns later and apologizes, offering to make it up by taking her to dinner. Mamita refuses, telling Gaston that, with his reputation, a young girl seen in his company might be labelled in such a way as could damage her future. Gaston is enraged again, storms out, and wanders the streets of Paris in a fury.Gaston realises that he has fallen in love with Gigi. He returns to Mamita and strikes a business arrangement to take Gigi as his mistress, promising to provide the girl with luxury and kindness. He visits Gigi later, but she tells him she does not wish to become someone's mistress; she wants more for herself than to be passed between men, only desired until they grow tired of her and she is moved on to another. Gaston is horrified at this portrayal of the life he wishes to give her, and leaves stunned. Later, however, Gigi contacts him; when Gaston returns, Gigi says she would ""rather be miserable with [him] than without [him].""Later that night Gigi emerges from her room prepared to accept her fate and take up her role as Gaston's mistress. For the first time, she appears as a woman, not a young girl. Gaston is enchanted when he picks Gigi up to take her to dinner at Maxim's, a popular Paris restaurant. Gigi's awkwardness is gone and she seems perfectly at ease. Nevertheless, patrons' stares make Gaston uncomfortable as he realises Gigi's interpretation of things may have been accurate after all.  He discovers that his love for her makes the idea of her as his mistress an unbearable one. Angered by Honoré's comments, Gaston leaves the party with Gigi in tow, taking her home without explanation. A weeping Gigi begs to know what she has done to offend him, but Gaston does not answer until he arrives at Mamita's and humbly asks for Gigi's hand in marriage.","The viewer meets the rich bachelor, whose name is Gaston, tired of the luxurious life and uncountable number of women. He gets satisfaction only from socializing with the old friend of his uncle, Madame Alvarez, whom he tenderly calls Mamita. But even more he enjoys society of her granddaughter, pretty and carefree Gigi who is actually called Gilberte. His uncle Honoré Lachaille once had romantic relations with Madame Alvarez, but over time, memory about former feelings was erased.  Mamita sends Gigi to Alicia, her aunt, to learn, according to family traditions, to be the courtesan. First, Gigi appears as the incapable student, as she doesn't understand the purposes and the reasons of the training. She doesn't understand love intrigues, but despite it, she likes to spend time with Gus, though she perceives him as an elder brother. Alicia is dissatisfied when the girl leaves for holidays with Gus and Mamita without her consent. She claims that the girl has to pay more attention to the education if she wants to catch Gaston. Madame Alvarez is dissatisfied, but understands, what advantages it will bring to the girl. Nobody devotes Gigi in the plans, and the girl, though she isn't especially successful in study, patiently goes through all the hardships.  Once Gaston makes a visit and sees Gigi in a magnificent white dress. He offends her in confusion, declaring that she looks disgustingly, and takes off for a door. Later he repents and offers the girl a joint dinner as an apology. Mamita refuses, explaining him that society of the person with his reputation can do much harm to the future of the girl. Furious Gaston wanders along the Parisian streets.  He comprehends his feelings to Gigi and suggests Madame Alvarez to give him the girl as the mistress, in exchange promising to take care of her and to provide her with money. The girl, however, declares that doesn't want to depend on men and to be someone's mistress. Gaston is shocked by her words. Nevertheless, later, Gigi contacts him and agrees with a proposed role.  After that, the audience for the first time sees her as a woman, but not a young girl. Gaston takes her to the expensive Parisian restaurant where she behaves elegantly and feels at ease, without former awkwardness. However, Gaston understands how the girl looks in his company. He understands that loves her too much to hold near oneself as the mistress. Soon he takes her away from the restaurant without any explanation. When they come to Madame Alvarez, he makes her the proposal of marriage."
Beetlejuice,"  Act I A group of people at a graveyard mourn the passing of Emily Deetz. Emily's daughter, Lydia, reflects on the death of her mother and her own inability to be noticed by her father, Charles (""Prologue: Invisible""). A millennia old demon named Beetlejuice arrives, states that this strays so much from the source material, and claiming that living life to the fullest is pointless, as it will all be worthless once death comes (""The Whole ""Being Dead"" Thing""). Beetlejuice then tells the audience, through means of breaking the fourth wall, how as a demon, he is invisible to all living beings unless he gets someone to say his name three times, and reveals that he has a plan to accomplish this.Beetlejuice then introduces Adam and Barbara Maitland. They are a normal married couple who desperately want to start a family, but are not emotionally ready and project their insecurities onto their hobbies. As Adam and Barbara reason to themselves why they're not ready for a child, they fall to their deaths through unstable floorboards in their home (""Ready, Set, Not Yet""). The ""Handbook for the Recently Deceased"" falls from the sky, but Beetlejuice burns it, wanting the newly deceased Maitlands to haunt their house and get a living person to say his name three times, which will allow him to be seen by all living beings. When Barbara and Adam awaken from their fatal fall and realize that they are dead, Beetlejuice reveals himself to the couple and offers to help them adjust to the Afterlife (""The Whole ""Being Dead"" Thing, Pt. 2""). Beetlejuice reveals to the Maitlands that the Deetzes have bought their house. He tells them that in order to remain in their house alone, they will have to scare the Deetzes away, and the Maitlands accept his help (""The Whole ""Being Dead"" Thing, Pt. 3"").While moving in, Charles reveals to Lydia that he wants to start a gated community, using the house as a flagship model home, and is having a dinner party with some business friends. Lydia expresses her desire for her mother to return, mentioning the fact that nobody seems to care that she's gone. Praying for her mother to send a sign that she's still there, Lydia vows to make her father acknowledge the fact that tragedy struck their family (""Dead Mom""). In the attic, Beetlejuice is trying to teach the Maitlands how to be scary. Despite his best attempts, Barbara and Adam are not scary at all (""Fright of Their Lives""). Beetlejuice becomes frustrated with the couple and abandons them, and they vow to scare the Deetz family away themselves (""Ready Set (Reprise)""). Meanwhile, Delia, a woman who Charles hired to be Lydia's life coach and is secretly his lover, tells Lydia how everything happens for a reason, but fails to get her in a positive state of mind (""No Reason""). After their session, Lydia meets the Maitlands as they are roaming the house trying to scare the Deetzes. Lydia wants to leave the house just as much as the Maitlands want her family out, so she tries to convince her dad that the house is haunted only to find out that he and Delia are engaged.Feeling as if Charles is just trying to replace her mother, Lydia flees to the roof, where a depressed Beetlejuice laments that he will never be seen (""Invisible (Reprise)""). Beetlejuice becomes ecstatic when he realizes Lydia can see him and tries to convince her not to kill herself, with the intention of getting her to free him from his curse. Lydia teases Beetlejuice, but does not say his name. The Maitlands come to check on Lydia only to be possessed by Beetlejuice into saying positive things about him to further convince Lydia. Upon learning about possession and that any ghost can do it, regardless of skill, Lydia decides not to work with Beetlejuice and instead work with the Maitlands to ruin Charles' dinner party (""Say My Name"").At the dinner party, Barbara and Adam possess Charles, Delia, and their guests (""Day-O (The Banana Boat Song)""). However, instead of being scared, the investors see the ghosts as a selling point, making them more interested in Charles' project. Feeling desperate, Lydia resorts to summoning Beetlejuice. Now visible to the living and able to affect the world around him, he forces the Maitlands to the attic before throwing Charles, Delia and the investors out of the house, much to Lydia's joy. Act II A Girl Scout named Sky explains to the audience how she has a heart condition where anything shocking could stop her heart but nevertheless is excited to be a Girl Scout. She rings the doorbell of the Deetzes' house to be greeted by Lydia, who invites her inside (""Girl Scout""). Beetlejuice appears and frightens the poor girl into leaving the house. He summons more versions of himself to help Lydia scare every visitor that comes into the house (""That Beautiful Sound""). Beetlejuice tells Lydia that now that she lives and works among the dead, she should also follow their rules, and gives her a copy of the Handbook for the Recently Deceased. However, because she is not dead, Lydia can't open it. Lydia realizes the book could help her reunite with her mother, and runs to the attic for Barbara and Adam's help.

Beetlejuice tricks Lydia by telling her that reading a passage from the book will resurrect her mother, but instead she unknowingly begins an exorcism of Barbara and is forced to agree to marry Beetlejuice to stop it (""The Whole ""Being Dead"" Thing, Pt. 4""). Beetlejuice stops the exorcism and opens a door to the Netherworld to send the Maitlands away for good, but Lydia jumps through the door, with Charles following.Lydia and Charles enter the Netherworld to be greeted by Miss Argentina, who along with other Netherworld residents, urges her to return to the living world (""What I Know Now"").

Parade,"  Act I The musical opens in Marietta, Georgia, in the time of the American Civil War. The sounds of drums herald the appearance of a young Confederate soldier, bidding farewell to his sweetheart as he goes to fight for his homeland. The years pass and suddenly it is 1913. The young soldier has become an old one-legged veteran who is preparing to march in the annual Confederate Memorial Day parade (""The Old Red Hills of Home""). As the Parade begins (""The Dream of Atlanta""), Leo Frank, a Yankee Jew from Brooklyn, NYC, is deeply uncomfortable in the town in which he works and lives, feeling out of place due to his Judaism and his college education (""How Can I Call This Home?""). His discomfort is present even in his relationship with his wife, Lucille, who has planned an outdoor meal spoiled by Leo's decision to go into work on a holiday.  Meanwhile, two local teens, Frankie Epps and Mary Phagan, ride a trolley car and flirt.  Frankie wants Mary to go to the picture show with him, but Mary playfully resists, insisting her mother will not let her (""The Picture Show"").  Mary leaves to collect her pay from the pencil factory managed by Frank.  While Frank is at work, Lucille bemoans the state of their marriage, believing herself unappreciated by a man so wrapped up in himself. She reflects on her unfulfilled life and wonders whether or not Leo was the right match for her (""Leo at Work"" / ""What Am I Waiting For?""). Mary Phagan arrives in Leo's office to collect her paycheck. That night, two policeman, Detective Starnes and Officer Ivey, rouse Frank from his sleep, and without telling him why, demand he accompany them to the factory, where the body of Mary Phagan has been found raped and murdered in the basement.  The Police immediately suspects Newt Lee, the African-American night watchman who discovered the body (""Interrogation""). Throughout his interrogation, he maintains his innocence, but inadvertently directs Starnes' suspicion upon Frank, who did not answer his telephone when Lee called him to report the incident. Leo is arrested, but not charged, and Mrs. Phagan, Mary's mother, becomes aware of Mary's death.Across town, a reporter named Britt Craig is informed about Mary's murder and sees the possibility of a career-making story (""Big News""). Craig attends Mary's funeral, where the townspeople of Marietta are angry, mournful, and baffled by the tragedy that has so unexpectedly shattered the community. (""There is a Fountain"" / ""It Don't Make Sense""). Frankie Epps swears revenge on Mary's killer, as does Tom Watson, a writer for The Jeffersonian, an extremist right-wing newspaper (""Tom Watson's Lullaby"") who has taken a special interest in the case. In the meantime, Governor John Slaton pressures the local prosecutor Hugh Dorsey to get to the bottom of the whole affair. Dorsey, an ambitious politician with a ""lousy conviction record"", resolves to find the murderer. Dorsey, along with Starnes and Ivey interrogate Newt Lee, but they get no information. Dorsey releases Newt, reasoning that ""hanging another Nigra ain't enough this time. We gotta do better."" He then attaches the blame to Leo Frank, and sends Starnes and a reluctant Ivey out to find eyewitnesses (""Something Ain't Right""). Craig exalts in his opportunity to cover a ""real"" story and begins an effective campaign vilifying Leo Frank. (""Real Big News""). Leo meets with his lawyer, Luther Z. Rosser, who vows to ""win this case, and send him home"". Meanwhile, Dorsey makes a deal with factory janitor and ex-convict Jim Conley to testify against Frank in exchange for immunity for a previous escape from prison. Lucille, hounded by reporters, collapses from the strain and privately rebukes Craig when he attempts to get an interview (""You Don't Know This Man""). She tells her husband that she cannot bear to see his trial, but he begs her to stay in the courtroom, as her not appearing would make him look guilty.The trial of Leo Frank begins, presided over by Judge Roan. A hysterical crowd gathers outside the courtroom, as Tom Watson spews invective (""Hammer of Justice"") and Hugh Dorsey begins the case for the prosecution (""Twenty Miles from Marietta""). The prosecution produces a series of witnesses, most of whom give trumped evidence which was clearly fed to them by Dorsey. Frankie Epps testifies, falsely, that Mary mentioned that Frank ""looks at her funny"" when they last spoke, a sentiment echoed verbatim by three of Mary's teenage co-workers, Iola, Essie, and Monteen (""The Factory Girls""). In a fantasy sequence, Frank becomes the lecherous seducer of their testimony (""Come Up to My Office""). Testimony is heard from Mary's mother (""My Child Will Forgive Me"") and Minnie McKnight before the prosecution's star witness, Jim Conley, takes the stand, claiming that he witnessed the murder and helped Frank cover up the crime (""That's What He Said""). Leo is desperate. As prosecutor Hugh Dorsey whips the observers and jurors at the trial into a frenzy, Leo is given the opportunity to deliver a statement. Leo offers a heartfelt speech, pleading to be believed (""It's Hard to Speak My Heart""), but it is not enough.  He is found guilty and sentenced to hang. The crowd breaks out into a jubilant cakewalk as Lucille and Leo embrace, terrified (""Summation and Cakewalk""). Act II Leo has begun his process of appeal. The trial has been noted by the press in the north, and the reaction is strongly disapproving of the way in which it was conducted, but the African-American domestics wonder if the reaction would have been as strong if the victim had been black (""A Rumblin' and a Rollin'""). Lucille tries to help Leo with his appeal, but reveals crucial information to Craig, provoking a fight between Leo and Lucille (""Do it Alone""). Lucille then finds Governor Slaton at a party (""Pretty Music"") and attempts to advocate for Leo. She accuses him of either being a fool or a coward if he accepts the outcome of the trial as is. Meanwhile, Tom Watson approaches Hugh Dorsey and tells him that he will support his bid for governor should he choose to make it. Dorsey and Judge Roan go on a fishing trip, where they discuss the political climate and the upcoming election (""The Glory"").The governor agrees to re-open the case, and Leo and Lucille rejoice (""This is Not Over Yet""). Slaton visits the factory girls, who admit to their exaggeration (“Factory Girls (Reprise)”), and Minnie, who claims that Dorsey intimidated her and made her sign a statement (“Minnie McKnight's Reprise”). Slaton also visits Jim Conley, who is back in jail as an accessory to the murder, who refuses to change his story despite the noticeable inconsistencies with the evidence, and along with his Chain Gang, does not give any information, much to the chagrin of Slaton (""Blues: Feel the Rain Fall""). After much consideration, he agrees to commute Frank's sentence to life in prison in Milledgeville, Georgia, a move that effectively ends his political career.  The citizens of Marietta, led by Dorsey and Watson, are enraged and riot (""Where Will You Stand When the Flood Comes?""). Leo has been transferred to a prison work-farm. Lucille visits and he realizes his deep love for his wife and how much he has underestimated her (""All the Wasted Time""). After Lucille departs from the prison, a party of masked men (including Starnes, Ivey, Frankie Epps, the Fulton Tower guard and the Old Confederate Soldier) arrives and kidnaps Leo. They take him to Marietta and demand he confess to the murder on pain of death. Leo refuses, and although Ivey is convinced of his innocence, the rest of group is determined to kill him. As his last request, Leo has a sack tied around his waist, since he is wearing only his nightshirt, and gives his wedding ring to Ivey to be given to Lucille. The group hangs him from an oak tree (""Sh'ma""). Some time later, a remorseful Britt Craig gives Leo's ring, which has been delivered to him anonymously, to Lucille. He is surprised to discover that she has no plans to leave Georgia, which is now governed by Dorsey, but she refuses to let Leo's ordeal be for nothing. Alone, she gives into her grief, but she takes comfort in believing that Leo is with God and free from his ordeal. The Confederate Memorial Day Parade begins again (""Finale"").","In the Marietta town, there was a parade, dedicated to the memory of the Confederacy. After the start of celebration, Jewish Yankees Leo, who grew up in Brooklyn, again experienced the discomfort of living in this town. Negative feelings of men influenced his relationship with wife. Lucille wanted to go on a picnic with her husband, but a man decided to go to work. At the same time, two teenagers were riding at a tram and flirting with each other. Frankie wanted Mary went with him to the movie, but the 13-year-old girl did not agree to it. Soon, she stated that she had to go to the factory and get her paycheck.  When Leo went to work, his wife began to reflect on their marriage. She began to doubt about the correctness of own decision to marry this man. Mary came to the factory and received a salary from the manager. That same night, in the house of Frank knocked detective Starnes and officer Ivey. They took Leo to the factory. They found a dead Mary, abused by someone. The body of a girl was found by a black security guard. The police began to suspect the man of having committed a crime, but he pleaded not guilty. The guard said that after the body was found, no one answered at his call to manager of the factory. Police arrested Leo, but did not charge him yet. Soon the family of a murdered girl found out about her death.  Reporter Britt decided to make his career on this event. Governor Slaton began to make pressure on the Prosecutor Mr. Dorsey. Britt attended the funeral of a girl. He saw that the locals were furious about the crime. Frankie vowed to revenge the killer. The same said Tom, a writer for the local extremist newspaper. Prosecutor had questioned the security guard of the factory. Having received no information, he ordered the release him, as he didn’t want to damage own career. Dorsey suspected the manager in murder and sent police to find witnesses. Reporter Craig launched a campaign of denigration of Leo.  The prosecutor made a deal with a factory janitor. He, former convict, agreed to give false testimonies against Leo. Manager asked his wife to attend the trial. They realized that truly love each other. The prosecutor invited the witnesses, who testified that Leo called attention to Mary. Jim said about his aid in order to conceal the murder. The charges were false, but the judge found the man guilty. The manager was sentenced to death. The lawyer and the defendant appealed. Lucille tried to help her husband. She was able to meet with the Governor. The woman said that the sentence was handed down based on false charges. The governor agreed to review the case of the murder.  Slaton met with eyewitnesses. Many people have reported that the public prosecutor forced them to testify. Only ex-convict has not retracted his words. After much deliberation, the governor changed the verdict. He decided that Leo would be prosecuted to a life sentence in prison. Furious residents of Marietta secretly kidnapped manager. They tried to force him to confess the murder, but the man said that he was innocent. Only officer Ivey believed him. Soon a crowd lynched Leo. Lucille had decided not to leave the city, where was held the execution of her husband. Departure would confirm the false accusations against Leo, and the death of the man would be in vain. At the end, the inhabitants of Marietta reiterated the parade in memory of the Confederacy."

Eileen, at least, has gotten food from a food samples man, as well as Mr. Valenti, but has also met Frank Lippencott, a local Walgreens manager who has developed a crush on her. Ruth, however, is left to wonder at her sister's magnetic appeal and her own unique romantic abilities — a talent for repelling men so successful that she could write a book entitled ""One Hundred Easy Ways to Lose a Man.""Eventually, Ruth talks her way into the offices of a short story magazine, where she meets Bob Baker. Bob likes Ruth, but advises her that she has little chance of success, and  tells her flat out what a waste of money and time it was to come to New York City, because he along with many others have done the same thing (What a Waste). Undaunted, Ruth leaves three stories with Bob in the hope that he will read them. Meanwhile, Eileen has been eating all of her lunches free at Walgreens, and finds herself infatuated with Frank (A Little Bit in Love), and invites him over to dinner so Ruth can have free lunches when she goes to Walgreens, too.

Elder Edith has an amazing voice, but because of the domineering husband, could not realize her dreams. The younger has tremendous acting talent, she just has to show her.

But a Little Edith is unhappy about it, because she has came far away from New York City now and her future career as an actress. Her father forbidding her to think of this career. He wants to exhort all sorts of nonsense from her head, inspired by the thoughtless behavior of the mother, which forces her to settle down and to find a husband.  But time passes and the crisis forced to cut expenses, on which the older Edith only shrugs from her husband, as an annoying fly, continuing to lead an idle way of life in the Garden with her lover, while her husband is at work. This cannot but lead to nothing but to a serious conflict and, eventually, to divorce.  Mrs. Beale’s frivolous attitude to life forces Mr. Beale to take his daughter from mother to New York to raise her at his own and to drive off a young head irrelevant thoughts of bohemian future, which is unworthy of a girl of her position and education.  But younger Edith sees is this only an opportunity to escape from the Grey Gardens, towards New York and glory. She participates in fashion shows, cabaret acts and one day receives an invitation to audition on Broadway by a director, and, at the same time, receives the attention of the powerful man who becomes her lover.

Little Edie stubbornly finds a way to come back to New York and comes to visit her lover one day before the show on Broadway, which abandons a credulous girl in this same meeting. She was not able to cope with the emotions and loss, and because of the stress, she begins to lose hair. Edith remains in Grey Gardens, having lost confidence and faith in herself. Infantile older Edith does not give a chance to younger Edith to return to a normal life, trying to persuade to stay with her forever in the Gardens.  Thus forty years have passed. Women did not have enough funds to keep the estate, and because of this, this entire place has turned into only miserable memories of luxury and wealth. Grey Gardens thoroughly imbued with the spirit of despair, loneliness, unfulfilled hopes and cat urine. Nothing in this place says that here live aristocrats, preserved only pride, not asking for help. Forgotten by all."

Titanic,"  Prologue: The Launching Titanic's designer, Thomas Andrews marvels at the wondrous things mankind has accomplished (""In Every Age""); with the R.M.S. Titanic becoming the newest feat once thought impossible.  Stoker Fred Barrett arrives at the dock in Southampton, amazed by the feat of engineering (""How Did They Build Titanic?"").  He is joined by Lookout Frederick Fleet and wireless telegraph operator Harold Bride, and they gaze in awe at the ""Ship of Dreams"" (""There She Is"") as the crew arrives.  J. Bruce Ismay, Andrews, and Captain E. J. Smith congratulate each other on being the owner, designer, and captain of ""The Largest Moving Object"" in the world.  The ship's passengers arrive; the Third and Second Class passengers feel privileged to be aboard the maiden voyage of the grandest ship ever to sail (""I Must Get on that Ship"").  The First Class passengers arrive; their names and achievements are narrated by Second Class passenger Alice Beane (""1st Class Roster"").  The Titanic sets sail, and the assembled company wishes her a safe crossing (""Godspeed Titanic""). Act 1 Now at sea, Ismay arrives on the bridge to inform Smith that he plans for the Titanic to arrive in New York on Tuesday afternoon rather than Wednesday morning, while Andrews insists that the maiden voyage be a safe one.  As they've cleared land, Smith allows her speed to be increased slightly.  Barrett, in the boiler room, disagrees with the order on such a new ship, but nonetheless complies (""Barrett's Song"").As the voyage continues, Ismay demands increasingly more speed, so the ship can build an impressive reputation. Smith complies despite Andrews' objections and warnings of icebergs in their course.  Smith hails 1st Officer Murdoch's qualities, deeming him ready to assume a command of his own, but Murdoch feels he is not yet ready to handle the responsibilities of the job (""To Be a Captain"").In Second Class, Alice Beane longs for the grandeur that is First Class, while her husband Edgar, a successful hardware store owner, is content with their station.  Charles Clarke, who is traveling to America to become a journalist, is accompanied by his fiancee Caroline Neville. Caroline's father doesn't approve of the engagement, so they are eloping to America.  In First Class, the titans of industry recount the accomplishments that man has recently achieved, with the Titanic becoming the pinnacle. (""What a Remarkable Age This Is!"").  In steerage, three Irish lasses—each named Kate—dream with the rest of Third Class of the opportunities that await them in America (""Lady's Maid"").  Kate McGowan is smitten with a young man traveling with them, Jim Farrell.In the wireless room, Bride is overwhelmed by the passengers' personal messages to be sent, though he finds time to handle Barrett's proposal to his girlfriend (""The Proposal/The Night Was Alive"").On Sunday morning, the First Class attends religious services (""God Lift Me Up""), then dances on deck to ""The Latest Rag"".  Alice Beane has managed to infiltrate their ranks, though she is turned away several times by an alert steward.  Edgar finds her and the two argue over their lifestyle choices (""I Have Danced"").  As evening draws near, the temperature drops, and lookout Fleet finds the weather conditions difficult for spotting icebergs (""No Moon"").  On deck, Kate McGowan tells Farrell that she needs to marry as she is carrying the child of a married man, and he accepts.  Elderly passengers Isidor and Ida Straus discuss their plans for the years to come while Charlotte Drake Cardoza scandalizes the First Class men by joining them for cards in the First Class Smoke Room (""Autumn"").Suddenly, Fleet spots an iceberg and alerts the bridge.  Murdoch, who's the senior officer on the bridge, takes evasive action, but the Titanic strikes the iceberg. Act 2 The stewards begin waking the confused passengers, while they themselves do not have much information (""Wake Up, Wake Up"").  Capt. Smith arrives on the bridge and is briefed on the situation.  He orders all passengers to put on life vests, for Bride to begin sending distress messages, and for Andrews to inspect the damage.  Andrews informs Smith and Ismay that the damage inflicted is more than the ship is designed to endure and that the ship will sink, reminding them that there are only enough lifeboats for less than half of the people aboard.In the First Class Dining Salon, passengers refuse to believe that anything is wrong with the ship and are annoyed at being awakened in the middle of the night (""Dressed in Your Pyjamas in the Grand Salon"").  Crew members are assuring them that there is no reason to panic. No one is aware of the ship's growing peril until a food cart rolls on its own, showing the ship's growing tilt. All the passengers and crew members quickly hurry to the lifeboats.In Third Class, the three Kates and Farrell attempt to find a way up to boat deck, but are unable to until they are assisted by Barrett (""The Staircase""). Smith arrives in the radio room where Bride informs him that only the Carpathia is near enough to help, but is unable to arrive until after the Titanic has sunk.  Smith, Andrews, and Ismay argue over responsibility for the disaster (""The Blame"").Women and children are ordered into the lifeboats, while the men are forced to stay behind (""To the Lifeboats"").  Murdoch orders Fleet and Barrett into the last lifeboat to help man the oars, but Barrett doesn't know how to row a boat and lets Farrell, who can row, into the boat instead.  Barrett bids farewell to his absent girlfriend while the rest of the passengers do the same to their loved ones (""We'll Meet Tomorrow"").The bellboy tells the captain that all the life boats have been launched, and that those remaining aboard accept their fate. Murdoch tells the Captain that he takes full responsibility for the accident, but Smith forgives him and then laments on how he had gone his entire career without experiencing any accident. Henry Etches, the first class steward, says a prayer (""To Be A Captain"" (Reprise)). Isidor and Ida Straus (Ida had refused to leave her husband behind) affirm their long-lasting love for one another (""Still"").  As the Captain declares the ship officially lost, Andrews—life vest unworn—remains in the first-class smoking room, obsessing over the ship's plans. He visualizes redesigning her as well as the final moments of the souls left aboard as the ship sinks beneath the waves (""Mr. Andrews' Vision"").In the early hours of the morning, the survivors are rescued by the Carpathia.  Many of them recount the tragedy of the Titanic, mourning the loss of people and ship.  Bride and Ismay, along with several of the survivors, discuss the possibilities that could have prevented the disaster (""The Foundering"").  The survivors express hope that they will one day be reunited with their lost loved ones and abandoned dreams (""In Every Age/Finale"").","The action starts on a pier where a crowd gathers in the beginning day. A reason is unprecedented emergence of biggest in entire history of mankind cruise ship. Developer is surprised with own creation. He tells of the fact that he has done the unbelievable. Fireman arrives to a marina in this city. He was struck by a power of modern vessel. A huge crowd flooded this marina. Everyone hail the crew members. Representative of vessel’s owner firm & the captain of the ship felicitate each other with the triumph of human genius, to which contribute, without doubt, this liner. Future passengers begin to approach the pier. Those who bought tickets of lower class than 1st, are proud that they step on decks of this ship. When everyone boarded, the greatest in human history ship sailed.  When Titanic went out into the open waters, the company chairman, Mr. Ismay persuades the captain for ship to arrive in NY not in the Wednesday’s dawn, as it was planned previously, but on Tuesday’s afternoon. However, the captain insists on previously planned course because it is safe for the liner. The chairman proposes to speed-up, although stokers & a whole crew disagree with this decision.  A motley crowd gathered in the 2nd class. They all talk of own hopes and expectations from a long journey. At this time, the first-class passengers discuss the greatness of the human mind, which created this miracle. Young girl Kate McGowan travels with a man named Jim Farrell. The owner of the ship's company every day with more & more insistence tells of increasing the speed, because newspapers will write about this & the glory of the liner will spread around the world. Captain resists because it is a huge possibility to encounter icebergs.  With the approach of Sunday evening, the team notices that the weather is getting worse & it is very difficult to detect icebergs in such conditions. On the deck, a girl Kate talks to a man accompanying her on a journey. She says that in order to become a foster mother of his children, they should get married.  The second act begins with the turmoil: the side of the ship is damaged by iceberg. Stewards wake up in the night & take their working positions; the captain informed passengers to wear life jackets & gives the order to the radio room to make the distress calls. Command of the ship reported that the damage caused by an iceberg is more than to what the ship was designed for. The officers inform that soon the ship will sink down, but it is not sufficient number of lifeboats on the ship to save all the passengers.  At this time, the first-class passengers refuse to believe in what is happening, because the crewmembers say with confidence that nothing bad will happen. The situation worsens when bias on the ship becomes obvious & then panic grew among the passengers: all rush to the boats.  From the radio room reported that the next ship will not have time to quickly come to the rescue. The owner of the company, the captain & officers are arguing about whose fault is in imminent catastrophe. It was decided to save only the women & children in the boats, for men they simply didn’t have space. Officer Murdoch informs the captain that it was entirely his fault, but the captain forgives him.  The next early morning the first arrived at the crash site ship rescues those who managed to survive in the cold waters of the ocean. People mourn the dead relatives & friends & the owner of the company & the employees of radio room discuss whether it was possible to prevent the tragedy."

His boss Mr. Bungee had his own TV show, and every week he needed new songs for the frog, which hosted the broadcast. Working on the next task, Gordon realized that he was not progressing. He decided to take a break and went to a meeting with his agent and friend. During lunch, the young man lost consciousness. After an examination at the hospital, it was found out that in his brain is arterial-venous malformation. This disease might at any moment cause death of Gordon.

The young man began to cherish the relationships of those whom he loved. Because if surgery, Gordon received the opportunity to build his life anew. Now he appreciated every second, assigned to him by fate. The author decided to implement all the dreams that he would have in the future."
Ain't Misbehavin', ,"Such a writer of songs like Fats Waller, who was the Afro American, left a rich heritage and now, based on his singing, they have created and played a musical. Murray Horwitz wrote the book and Richard Maltby actively helped him in this. The music and lyrics were written by many composers and writers for this production – their names are too numerous to mention. Fats Waller had a song that gave its name to the whole musical – ""Ain't Misbehavin’”, which means “Don’t misbehave”.  There is no story in a musical, as such. Everything in it are: different people perform different songs. Men and women. Neat and dressed in evening dresses and suits. And the songs – not combed and not tolerant, having lots of social incomprehensibility, and with such humor that requires visual support to make it funny. That is – the most primitive one. These songs are about the state of the soul in the style of funk, primitive jazz, folk and ethno. This behavior on stage is to show how beautiful you are pulling a suit on or gown named as dress, because your immense figure fits in nothing because you eat unhealthy food in very large quantities. It's about how to go on the stage and sing something without even any hint of development, but simply do the fool, throwing the leg over the other."
Children of Eden," (American version)  Act I The musical opens with the creation story from the Book of Genesis (""Let There Be"") and the Storytellers, who narrate the piece, help Father (the God-character, who is always addressed as ""Father"") bring the universe and life  into existence, including Father's new children, Adam and Eve. Eve finds herself drawn to the tree of knowledge, though Father makes it clear to her that she must stay away from ""that tree,"" with no clear explanation (""The Tree of Knowledge""). Father then attempts to distract Adam and Eve by playing a game where they name all the animals in the garden (""The Naming""). With his children distracted for the time being, everything is right with the newly created world and Adam and Eve fall in love with one another (""Grateful Children"", ""Father's Day"", and ""Perfect""). Eve, however, still hungers for something more; she wants to see what lies beyond the garden (""The Spark of Creation""). She meets a snake that tempts her with the fruit from the forbidden tree and the possibilities that open up for her if she eats it. (""In Pursuit of Excellence""). Eve eats the fruit and is awakened to the possibility and the world that lies beyond. (""The End of a Perfect Day"" and ""Childhood's End""). Eve attempts to trick Adam into eating the apple in several apple-related dishes, though she stops him before he consumes any of them. Eve tells Adam that she ate of the Tree of Knowledge and, as Father calls from the distance, the two hide in the garden.Father finds his children and, after discovering Eve has eaten the apple, tells her that she must leave the garden as she is no longer innocent. And, in a twist from the Genesis tale, Adam is then torn between these two choices: he can either stay with Father in Eden, or he can eat the fruit and be banished with Eve. Adam decides that, even though it means leaving the garden that he loves with all his heart forever, he must be with Eve (""A World Without You""). Adam and Eve are driven out of the garden by Father into the wasteland surrounding the garden and have two children, Cain and Abel (""The Expulsion"" and ""The Wasteland""). Several years later, Adam and Eve, along with their children, continue with their lives, hoping and praying that Father will one day return and bring them home to Eden. Eve realizes that the same fire that led to her eating the fruit is present in her son, Cain (""The Spark of Creation (Reprise 1)""). Cain, like his mother, longs to see the world, but out of fear for their children's safety, Adam and Eve have set their glen as the boundary, with no chance of their children going beyond the waterfall. Cain, upset that his parents have trapped them and that they let themselves get kicked out of Eden, complains to Abel about the problems that their parents created for them and his desire to see what lies beyond (""Lost in the Wilderness""). He begs Abel to leave to find the glen with him, as Father appears. Both boys, having never seen Father, are shocked and assume that he has arrived to take them back to the garden. Father shows his love and affection and promises the brothers their very own wives. However, it quickly becomes clear that Father has no intention of seeing their parents or taking any of them back to Eden. Cain, embittered, packs his things, tells Father and Abel that he is going to go find his future out in the wasteland, and leaves the glen (""Lost in the Wilderness (Reprise)""). Father tells Abel to keep his visit secret from his parents, but that he will return to them.Adam and Eve, deeply worried about Cain's safety out in the Wasteland, find some comfort in the fact that they have been able to create a life and family for themselves outside of Eden (""Close to Home""), but this peacefulness is once again shattered when Cain, back from his journey, tells the family that he has found a ring of giant stones, seemingly providing evidence of other humans. Cain takes the family to see the stones in the wasteland, with Eve and Abel just as excited as Cain. Adam, however, admits to his family that he had seen the ring of stones and those who live there years before, but never told them as he was afraid of the potential consequences (""A Ring of Stones"" and ""Clash of the Generations""). Adam's betrayal quickly leads to a family-wide fight, culminating in Cain threatening to leave forever and taking Abel with him. Abel, fighting through his heartbreak, decides to stay with his parents. Cain, beginning to leave, is forcibly stopped by Adam, who slaps Cain, which sends him to the ground. Cain tells Adam that he will kill him and the two attempt to fight, but when Abel intervenes, he is thrown off Cain, who, in his rage, beats him to death with a stone (""The Death of Abel""). Cain leaves the remaining members of his family, telling Adam that it should have been him that should be dead. Father, in his anger, decrees that Cain's descendants will always bear a mark for the sin of their ancestor (""The Mark of Cain"").Many years after Abel's death and Cain's departure, Eve lives with her children and grandchildren and prepares herself for death. She attempts to speak to Father about Cain's departure from the family, Adam's grief over the loss of both his sons, the birth of another son, Seth, who has since had children of his own, and Adam's recent death. She prays that her children and her grandchildren will regain the garden that was lost, as Father allows her into heaven (""Children of Eden""). Act II The storytellers reconvene and continue their story, following the lineage of both Seth and Cain, eventually tracing all the way down to Noah and his family, whose story comprises the second act’s plot (""Generations"").Father, after centuries of facing the race of Cain, tells Noah that a storm is coming to wipe them all away, save Noah's family, as they remain the few who are untainted by Cain's lineage. Noah begs Father to reconsider, but Father leaves him with the command to build an ark for both his family and two of every animal (""The Gathering Storm"").Noah has three sons, and the eldest two, Shem and Ham, have wives, but his youngest son, Japheth, is unhappy with the wives Noah has tried to obtain for him. Instead, he wishes to marry the servant-girl, Yonah, a descendant of the race of Cain, and Japheth tells this to his surprised family (""A Piece of Eight""); however, Noah will not allow Yonah on the ark, due to her being a part of the race of Cain. All the animals, played by the Storytellers, come to the ark so that they can board and be saved from the flood (""The Return of the Animals"" and ""Noah's Lullaby""). Later, Noah finds Yonah outside and explains to her that she cannot board the ark, though he wishes she could and he leaves to board. She understands her plight and continues to face her problems with an open heart and mind, as she always has (""Stranger to the Rain""). Japheth finds Yonah as she's leaving and attempts to convince her to sneak on to the ark with him. Japheth tells Yonah that he doesn't care about the repercussions of his actions, as long as he can be with her. The two vow to spend whatever time they have left with one another and board the ark (""In Whatever Time We Have""), just as Father unleashes his wrath on the earth and the race of Cain (""The Flood"").For forty days and forty nights, the rain continues, never ceasing, and tensions on the ark are high, with couples fighting and discussions on how to stay alive in these desperate conditions, including killing animals on the ark for food (""What is He Waiting For?""). Yonah, having stayed undiscovered, releases a dove to find dry land and save the residents of the ark (""Sailor of the Skies""). The family discovers Yonah, and Shem and Ham wish to throw her overboard, but Japheth intervenes.  It escalates into a fight, directly mirroring the one between Adam and Cain generations ago, and it is only because Yonah intervenes that one of the brothers is not killed. Noah is unsure as to what he must do, sends the family away from him and attempts to talk to Father. His wife asks him if Father speaks to him anymore, and when Noah answers ""No"", she tells him, ""You must be the father now;"" that Noah has to live without God telling him what to do (""The Spark of Creation (Reprise 2)""). Noah sings of the difficulties that he has faced in being a father, while at the same time Father sings of the problems he has faced in being a father, but both come to terms with the fact that if you love something, you must let it go (""The Hardest Part of Love"").Noah calls the family together once more, all of them desperate for guidance and hope (""Words of Doom""). He decides to give Japheth and Yonah his blessing as the family gathers together to spend whatever time they have left as a happy, loving family (""The Hour of Darkness""). Then the dove Yonah released returns with an olive branch in its mouth, signifying nearby land, and the family again sees the light of the stars. The family rejoices as Mama leads the family in the gospel song (""Ain't It Good?""). Father gives humanity the power to control its fate and gives his blessing to find their future without his direct influence (""Precious Children""). As the family lands and leaves the ark, they separate, taking various animals to their new homes across the world. As they say their final goodbyes, the family sings of the problems they will face and their desire to return someday to the Garden of Eden (""In the Beginning"").","""Let There Be"" opens the story of creation, Book of Genesis. Here the Creator though populated Earth with people, animals, fish and reptiles, for some reason does not want Adam and Eve approached and get acquainted. In addition to the fact that Eve violates the prohibition to come close to the Tree of Knowledge, she is also constantly wants something more than having today, representing a significant desire for knowledge, unlike Adam, who looks like a scatty boy.  There is a very interesting storyline dualism, which is almost never portrayed in the classical adaptations of the original biblical story. Adam turns out to have a choice – to either stay in the Garden of Eden or either to bite from the Apple of Knowledge and being ejected along with Eve. He chooses to stay with Eve, and banished from the Garden, and then they have children with well-known names. Cain as much as his mother, eager to learn and gives the word to his parents that he would find the Garden of Eden, going on a journey. During the search, he discovers traces of the presence of other people, saying this to his father. Adam admits that he knew about it, but was afraid to tell a family because of the negative consequences. Cain becomes hysterical, and in the heat of a fight with his father, accidentally kills his brother, raising his hand to kill Adam. Adam curses Cain for eternity. Eve gives birth to another son, Seth, who had his own children. Eva dies.  Then many of the descendants are born from Cain and Seth, and it comes to Noah and his family, and the second act of the musical tells about events from Noah’s life. He learns about the great flood and he builds The Arc. All three sons of Noah are on the Ark with their wives, while a third had some trouble because of his wife, due to Noah who initially did not want to take her along, because she was a descendant of Cain, fratricide, and wore the mark of his tribe.  After discovering that his wife is aboard, at first, other wanted to throw her overboard, but husband did not allow his brothers to do so. The case turns into a fight, but wise Noah decides that even people from a sort of Cain deserve to live, as Deity wanted to let them to, so he leaves her on the board. Soon there comes an enlightenment in the veil of heaven and they see the stars, the flood subsides and they are preparing for a new life (""In the Beginning"")."
High School Musical on Stage!,"  Act I At East High School (in Albuquerque, New Mexico) (""Wildcat Cheer""), Troy Bolton tells his Jock friends, Chad Danforth and Zeke Baylor, about meeting Gabriella Montez on New Year's Eve during winter vacation on a ski trip. Gabriella, who has just moved to Albuquerque, also tells her newfound Brainiac friends Taylor McKessie, Kelsi Nielsen and Martha Cox  of her vacation. We meet Sharpay and Ryan Evans, the two drama stars of the school. Sharpay is selfish, and Ryan follows her orders but tries to be friends with everyone. Troy and Gabriella have a flashback to New Year's Eve when they met. (""Start of Something New""). One-half of the song is during the flashback, then we return to East High where Chad, Taylor, Kelsi, Ryan, Sharpay, Zeke and other students sing of their New Year's Resolutions.In homeroom, Mrs. Darbus tells her class of the upcoming winter musical, ""Juliet and Romeo"", a new version of Shakespeare's ""Romeo and Juliet"", written by Kelsi Nielsen, a shy East High student. When Ryan, Sharpay, Troy, and Gabriella start using their cell phones, Mrs. Darbus gives them all detention. Chad interferes, telling Mrs. Darbus that Troy cannot go because they have basketball practice after school and that they have an upcoming championship game. Mrs. Darbus then gives Chad a 30-minute detention, and gives Taylor detention when she remarks that Chad can't even count that high. At Gabriella's locker, Troy runs into her and they show their amazement of how they found each other again. Sharpay walks by and tries to flirt with Troy, but he shows no interest in her. Sharpay observes that he is interested in Gabriella and she is interested in him. Later, the Jocks have basketball practice (""Get'cha Head in the Game"").In a Science class, Gabriella shows her smarts by pointing out a flaw in the teacher's equation. Taylor is impressed and asks, on behalf of her Science Club, if Gabriella could join their team to win the upcoming Scholastic Decathlon, although Gabriella refuses. Sharpay overhears and has Ryan investigate by Googling her.Discovering that Gabriella was a very intelligent Brainiac at her old school, Sharpay prints her newfound information and puts it in Taylor's locker. The students later head to the Mrs. Darbus's room for detention, and act like animals. Taylor then asks Gabriella again to join the Scholastic Decathlon team based on the printouts Sharpay planted in her locker, and Gabriella agrees. Everyone does the 'ball of noise,' and  Coach Bolton comes to get Troy and Chad for practice and then talks to Mrs. Darbus about it.The next day, thespians audition for the play (""Auditions""). Sharpay and Ryan audition as well (""What I've Been Looking For""). After the auditions have been declared closed, Gabriella and Troy sing the song as Kelsi intended it - much slower (""What I've Been Looking For (Reprise)""). Although Troy and Gabriella did not intend it to be an audition they are called back for a second audition. When their friends hear the news they spread it via cell phones (""Cellular Fusion"").Sharpay is furious, believing Troy and Gabriella have stolen the lead roles and broken the 'rules' of East High. Though most of the school agrees, lyrical chaos erupts during a lunch break when students begin telling their secret obsessions outside of their cliques (""Stick to the Status Quo""). The scene culminates with Sharpay getting 'caked' by Zeke (who secretly likes her), after Gabriella spins into him. Act I ends with Sharpay angrily shouting ""Someone is going to pay for this!"" Act II Jack Scott recaps events before Troy and Gabriella dance on the rooftop garden (""I Can't Take My Eyes Off of You""). Zeke comes to Sharpay's locker and tries to flirt with her. Meanwhile, the Jocks and Brainiacs plot against the infuriated duo during study hall. Sharpay and Ryan see the Jocks and the Brainiacs mingling together and imagine they are trying to help Troy and Gabriella. So Sharpay lies to Mrs. Darbus saying that Troy and his dad are trying to ruin the auditions because she gave Troy detention. Later at practice, (""Wildcat Cheer (Reprise)""), Mrs. Darbus talks to Troy's dad and then he talks to Troy. Gabriella comes to practice to see Troy while Martha comes and takes her to the lab. Troy's dad thinks Gabriella is the reason why Troy got detention. He tells Troy that he is a playmaker and not a singer. This infuriates Troy who angrily asks his father if he ever wondered if he could be both and storms off in a rage, leaving his father stunned.The Jocks and Brainiacs put their plan to work, pushing at Troy and Gabriella to 'split up'. Eventually, Troy, furious with his friends for telling him the same things his dad did, gives in and pretends that he doesn't like Gabriella, completely oblivious to the phone in Zeke's hand, transmitting Troy's words directly to Gabriella (""Counting on You""). Gabriella hears and becomes very upset. Troy and Gabriella, lonely and upset, sing (""When There Was Me and You""). The Jocks and Brainiacs then realize that they have gone too far and feel guilty for ruining Troy and Gabriella's relationship.The next day, Sharpay and Ryan are rehearsing for their callback while Sharpay talks to Ryan about her role in the school. Then Troy comes in looking for Gabriella and Ryan tells him that she is in the theatre. Troy goes to the theatre and tells Gabriella that they were set up and he didn't mean what he said and sings to remind her of New Year's (""Start of Something New (Reprise)"").Hearing that the callback date has been moved up by request of Sharpay to the same time as the big game and the Scholastic Decathlon, Troy and Gabriella announce to the Jocks and Brainiacs that they are going to not do the callback, but instead help their respective teams for their events. The Jocks and Brainiacs say they should do the callbacks. Troy and Gabriella refuse, but the teams decide to lend a helping hand anyway (""We're All In This Together"").On the day of the big game/Decathlon/callbacks, the students are excited for the festivities. Sharpay and Ryan perform their callback song (""Bop to the Top""), which at the same time happens with the basketball championship and the science decathlon, during which Taylor engineers an electronic meltdown in the decathlon and light malfunctions in the game, which forces all the students to move to the theater. Chad and Taylor explain to Troy and Gabriella that this is their only chance. Mrs. Darbus, hesitant to allow Troy and Gabriella an audition due to their lateness, has no choice but to let them audition as the auditorium fills with students (""Breaking Free"").  Mrs. Darbus gives Troy and Gabriella the parts on the spot with everyone watching.The end of Act II brings us to the gym where all the main characters wrap up their plots (Chad asks Taylor to an after-party, Zeke gets Sharpay to be nice to him, Jack Scott and Kelsi flirt, and Sharpay makes up with Gabriella and Troy). The Wildcats win the big game and the Decathlon. The students celebrate (""We're All in This Together (Reprise)"") followed by a recap of all the major songs in the show (""Megamix"") during the curtain call.","The show begins with a scene at school. Troy says to his friends that he has met Gabriella. Then Sharpay and her brother Rayan appear. The girl is very vainglorious and constantly demands that Rayan should follow her orders. He agrees, but at the same time, he doesn't want to quarrel with anybody. In the following scene, a viewer is transferred to the moment at a party, when Troy and Gabriella meet.  Imperceptible and modest Kelsey writes her own version of ""Romeo and Juliette"". The students put show on the stage under the guidance of the teacher’s plan. At a lesson, Gabriella enters the class. Troy can't believe in it. He dials her number, which she has given him. The teacher, who hates mobiles at the lesson, punishes them and the guys, who interceded for them. Troy and Gabriella meet and talk in the corridor. Sharpay notices that Troy isn't indifferent to Gabriella.  Gabriella shows her knowledge at a chemistry lesson. Taylor suggests her to take part in the competitions with her team. But the girl refuses. They are overheard by Sharpay. Rayan and she find information about her on the Internet and enclose it into the Taylor’s locker. She publicly calls Gabriella to join their team once again and she has to agree. Sharpay and Rayan apply for receiving leading roles in the musical. But the teacher notices Troy and Gabriella singing the song before the audition and appoints the second one especially for them. Sharpay is angry. Meanwhile, the students of the school stop to be afraid to declare their dreams and desires. Troy and Gabriela dance on the roof of the school.  Sharpay says to the teacher that Troy's father (the basketball coach at school) and his son want to break the audition, because Troy was punished by her. The teacher, in her turn, speaks with the trainer. He thinks that the reason of Troy's failures is Gabriella, and says to the son that he needs to do sports, not music. They quarrel. The sportsmen repeat the words of his father and, being in rage, Troy pretends that he doesn't like Gabriella. It is recorded on the video and shown to the girl. She is very upset. Troy tries to convince Gabriella that he has told these words not seriously, but just because he was angry. She trusts him. Sharpay changes dates of the audition, so that they coincide with Troy and Gabriela's competitions. They say to their teams that they won't participate in the musical because of it. But the teams promise to help them. They persuade the teacher to allow a delay and she agrees. As a result, Troy and Gabriella's teams win competitions. The students celebrate their victory together and sing the final song."
Can-Can," In Paris in 1893, the dance-hall in Montmartre owned by La Môme Pistache, Bal du Paradis, is being threatened with closing by a self-righteous judge, Aristide Forestier. He is offended by the scandalous but popular dance that the attractive dancers perform at the dance-hall, the ""Can-Can."" The judge sends the police to harass the owner and dancers, but the police like the dancers so much that they are reluctant to testify against them in court. The judge decides to gather evidence himself, and takes a trip to the club. Once there, he and the owner, La Môme, fall in love. He tries to keep his identity a secret but the girls recognize him. He sees the Can-Can and gets photographic evidence of its scandalousness. La Môme and the dancers are sent to jail.One of the dancers, Claudine, a laundry girl by day, has been pursued by Hilaire, an art critic, who plans to host an elaborate ball at the club. Claudine, who loves a sculptor, Boris, arranges to have dinner with Hilaire so that her sculptor will receive a favourable review. Now, with the proprietress and dancers locked up, the ball cannot go forward. The judge is struggling with the conflict between his moral scruples and his love for La Môme. Eventually, he concedes that ""obscenity is in the eye of the beholder"". He urges her to escape, but a journalist gets a photograph of him kissing her – a scandal for him!Hilaire criticises Boris's sculptures, and the cowardly artist manages to challenge the critic to a duel before fainting. Eventually, Hilaire writes a gushing review of Boris's work. Judge Aristide loses his judgeship and is disbarred, but La Môme and the girls all go to court with him and all win their cases.","Simple story, which revolves around a bit scandalous, but such familiar to us dance named ""Can-Can"", which was just gaining popularity in 1893. Events taking place in the location called Bal du Paradis, dance spot and cabaret, which actively promoted this dance. The local judge, who is overly pious with outdated looks, seemed the very existence of such a dance an obscene in nature and he has sent into the cabaret the police so they pursued the theater owner and its employees. But they are fascinated and seduced by the dance performers, and in the court were so reluctant to testify that the judge was disappointed in them and decided on his own to visit the cabaret to collect compromising materials.  During his visit, he falls in love at first sight with the owner, La Môme Pistache, she does not know who he is, at this moment of time. During the visit, he makes a lot of incriminating pictures and owner of the club, as well as all of her dancers, are jailed.  A member of the team that has not got to the prison, found a young man who is an over viewer of a nightlife and social events. She dines with him, insisting he would write a good review of their cabaret and, in particular – about the ""Can-Can"" dance, to rescue their troupe from prison. He was also aware of their existence and wanted to enact them in the show that was going to be arranged in one of the other places, but now that plans have failed because of the arrest of the dancers.  As long as they think, how to help the cause, it appears that the head leader is again a judge who thinks, not daring to decide uniquely – either he loves Pistache, and is ready to release her from prison, or else his morals are above everything else. As a result, this balancing is heading him to the fact that once an obscenity takes place only before the eyes of beholders, those who accept to visit such place, only they are responsible for what they see. So he rushes to the rescue of La Môme Pistache and releases her and all her girls out of jail. At the time of release, he kisses her – to his bad luck – this time they are eye-dropped by the photographer who made photo, where they kiss. For him, it turns into a scandal and he is deprived of the title of judge and law practice. But he and La Môme Pistache go to the courts, each in their own issue and win them. Cabaret resumes its activities, and the judge is restored to operation."
City of Angels," The setting is Hollywood in the late 1940s, with two stories occurring simultaneously: a Hollywood comedy and a detective drama. The real-life scenes feature full-color sets and costumes, while the movie scenes are in black-and-white. Most of the cast (with the exception of the actors playing Stine and Stone) doubles as characters in the ""real"" world and their fictive counterparts. Act I Stone, a tough Los Angeles private eye, lies on a hospital gurney with a bullet in his shoulder and a lot on his mind. He flashes back to a week earlier, when his loyal Girl Friday secretary, Oolie, ushered in a rich, beautiful woman named Alaura. Alaura claims she wants Stone to find her missing stepdaughter, Mallory Kingsley, a beautiful ""bad"" girl. Against his better judgment, he takes the case. A man at a typewriter appears onstage, and Stone and Alaura suddenly back up, ""rewind,"" and play the scene with a few changes. The man at the typewriter is Stine, author of the popular detective novel City of Angels, which he is adapting into a screenplay at the behest of Hollywood producer-director Buddy Fidler. His wife Gabby has misgivings and wishes that he would stick to novels, but for now, Stine is enjoying the ride.We begin to see the interplay between ""reality"" and fiction as Gabby (in the real world) and Oolie (in the story-within-the-story) lament how their men won't listen to them (""What You Don't Know About Women"").Stone, alone in his dreary bungalow, is listening to the radio: Jimmy Powers and the Angel City 4 are singing ""You Gotta Look Out For Yourself."" Two thugs break down his door, beat him up, and knock him out. Cut to Buddy Fidler reading this scene in the screenplay: we see that his secretary, Donna, is the model for Oolie, and that Buddy can't help meddling with everything (""The Buddy System"").Stone is rudely awakened by Lieutenant Munoz, who was Stone's partner on the force but now bears him a major grudge. Once, Stone loved a low-rent lounge singer named Bobbi, whom Stine based on Gabby (""With Every Breath I Take""). But Bobbi wanted stardom more than marriage, and when Stone caught her with a Hollywood producer (based on Buddy) tempers flared, a gun went off, and the producer was killed. Munoz has never forgiven Stone for ""getting away with murder.""Stone, angry after the beating, confronts Alaura at her mansion and meets several more unsavory characters, including her lustful stepson, her polio-stricken elderly husband, and his quack doctor. Greed and malice hover like smog, but Alaura's charms and bankroll keep Stone on the case (""The Tennis Song""). He fruitlessly pursues the missing Mallory in a scene that recalls a film montage (""Ev'rybody's Gotta Be Somewhere""), only to find her waiting naked in his bed (""Lost And Found""). Stone somehow manages to resist temptation -- which is more than can be said for his creator. After Gabby returns to New York, Stine takes comfort in Donna's bed.A photographer breaks into Stone's bungalow and snaps a picture of him with Mallory. She runs off with his gun, which is subsequently used to murder the quack doctor. Stone is framed for the killing; Munoz gleefully arrests him (""All You Have To Do Is Wait"").Stine is having a lousy time of it too. Buddy is butchering his script, his conscience is nagging him about his infidelity, and Stone, his own creation, is disgusted with him. The curtain falls with each of them arguing, to a swinging big-band accompaniment, ""You're Nothing Without Me."" Act II In a recording studio, Jimmy Powers and the Angel City 4 are singing ""Stay With Me,"" which then becomes a record playing in a bedroom that looks like Alaura's, but actually belongs to Carla Haywood, Buddy's wife, who will play Alaura in the movie.Stone languishes in jail, attended only by Oolie, who like her alter ego, Donna, is feeling used by men (""You Can Always Count On Me""). Stone is mysteriously bailed out, but the two hoods catch up with him and nearly blow him up before he neatly turns the tables.Stine has troubles of his own. Lonely at a Hollywood party of Buddy's sycophants, including a Hollywood composer (""Alaura's Theme""), Stine phones home only to find that Gabby has discovered that he cheated on her. He flies to New York with an elaborately prepared excuse, but she's not buying it (""It Needs Work"").Stone, fighting to clear his name, is led to a brothel (""LA Blues"") where he is stunned to find Bobbi. We learn it was she who shot the producer; Stone has been covering for her all this time. Together, they face the wreckage of their love (""With Every Breath I Take"").In Hollywood, Stine is approached by a young starlet, Avril, who will be playing Mallory. She begs him to reconsider killing off Mallory near the end. He says he'll think about it.Oolie, meanwhile, has discovered that Alaura is a fortune hunter who has already murdered one rich husband and is planning to do away with this one, once she had eliminated his son, daughter, and doctor. She tried to get her stepson, Peter, to kill the doctor and Mallory, but he couldn't bring himself to kill. Stone confronts her at the mansion; they grapple for her gun; shots ring out. Alaura falls dead, Stone is gravely wounded, and we're back where we started.But where does that leave Stine? Gabby has rejected him and his lover, Donna, has been rewriting his script. Stine faces the collapse of his real and fictive worlds, and as his emotions take over, his wit turns bitter (""Funny""). When Stine arrives on the movie set to find that Buddy's name appears above his on the screenplay, and that the shallow crooner Jimmy Powers will play Stone, Stine boils over. With the ""real"" Stone, his conscience, finally leading him to make the right choice, he rages at Buddy, gets himself fired, and is about to get beat up by two security guards when Stone somehow appears at Stine's typewriter and writes him the fighting skills of a superhero, then tacks on a ""Hollywood ending"" in which Gabby returns, forgiving all. Together they celebrate (""I'm Nothing Without You"") as the curtain falls.","A week ago, a private detective named Stone received new case from a beautiful woman named Alaura, who asked him to track down her missing stepdaughter. Then, when a man named Stine appears on stage, we understand that Stone actually is a figment of the imagination of Stine, and so Stone is the character of his new adventure-detective novel, which comes out of his head, thanks to the writers' fantasy of Stine. Narrative about the fate of these two people on the stage are beginning to weave in the story and now we see how Stone lying on a gurney in a hospital with a broken heart, an empty wallet and a bullet in the shoulder. Wife of Stine wants him to devote more time to his novels, but he prefers to live at the expense of his rich publisher, Buddy Fidler, resulting, for the most part, in his penchant for beautiful women.  One of the former partners of Stone, police Lt. Munoz, experience hostility to Stone, because could not nail him for the murder of one of the producers of Hollywood in the past, who molested his then-girlfriend. Stine took his secretary, Donna in his novel to be a prototype, and Stone pretty much copied from himself, giving a hero many of own features.  Came to the estate to his employer, Alaura, Stone sees her greedy and petty family – lustful son, a husband who cannot live without artificial lung, as well as quack-medicine man who visits them, not for the treatment of her husband, but for the sake of defrauding money. In a fit of disgust, he wants to give up the case, but he proves the opposite by Alaura, mainly by banking cheque for his services. Alaura proved to be depicted from the prototype of the wife of Buddy.  Through a series of events in finding missing stepdaughter, Stone finds her in his bed, but does not give in to the temptation. Whereas Stine is leaved by his wife and he is comforted by his secretary in her bed.  Publisher severely criticized a novel about Stone and Stine experience aversion to his character. The journalist breaks to his apartment and pictures the naked maiden in his bed, and he shoots him from his gun. Munoz gladly locks Stine down in the prison for that.  Stone visited in prison only by his secretary that is taken from Donna, who feels sympathy for Stone because he is the only one among the many men did not deceive her. Someone bails him, and then Stone is beaten-up by two thugs. Stine has problems because he now has no money for own favorable social life, and his wife finds out about his infidelity with a secretary. Though he tries to justify oneself in front of her, she did not believe him and he goes to a brothel.  Alaura is a woman who earns by murdering her husbands. Now she has lost her son somewhere, along with stepdaughter & doctor. When Stone enters her house, she just wanted to turn off the life support system of her husband, but Stone tried to stop her. At that same moment, her lover clutched a gun, and after bursting the shots, Stone ended up with a bullet in his shoulder & Alaura has appeared to be murdered. Stine’s boss fires him because he flared up against him. And he did so because Stone will be depicted on the film by some empty shallow person, and the name of his boss, Buddy, turned over his name in the list of writers of the script."
Bells Are Ringing," ACT ONEElla Peterson works for ""Susanswerphone"", a telephone answering service owned by a woman named Sue. She listens in on others' lives and adds some interest to her own humdrum existence by adopting different identities – and voices – for her clients. They include Blake Barton, an out-of-work Method actor, Dr. Kitchell, a dentist with musical yearnings but lacking talent, and playwright Jeff Moss, who is suffering from writer's block and with whom Ella has fallen in love, although she has never met him. Ella considers the relationships with these clients ""perfect"" because she can't see them and they can't see her (""It's a Perfect Relationship"").Jeff is writing a play called ""The Midas Touch,"" the first play he's written since his writing partner left him (""Independent (On My Own)""). One day the producer of the play insists that he finish the play by the next morning and meet him at 9:00 am. While asking her to wake him up on time, he turns to Ella (who he only knows as the Susanswerphone lady) for help in writing the play. Meanwhile, Sandor, Sue's rich boyfriend, reveals plans to a group of gangsters to use Susanswerphone as a front for a gambling operation, by pretending to be a record seller and taking orders for ""symphonies"" as code. (""It's a Simple Little System"").Ella wants to visit Jeff's apartment to help him write the play, but she is intercepted by a policeman who is convinced that Susanswerphone is a front for an ""escort service"". Ella asks him ""Is it a Crime?"" to help someone in need? He agrees that it isn't, and lets her go. She arrives at Jeff's apartment and offers him help with his play, and a romance ensues (""I Met a Girl,"" ""Long Before I Knew You"").ACT TWOElla is preparing to go to a party at Jeff's apartment, feeling nervous about meeting his friends. Carl, a friend of hers, helps her regain her confidence with a cha-cha dance (""Mu-Cha-Cha""). The guests at the party are all very pretentious and rich and snobby (""Drop That Name"") and they make Ella feel very out of place. She leaves Jeff (""The Party's Over"").Carl, a music nerd, thwarts Sandor's operation when he receives an order for ""Beethoven's 10th symphony,"" because he knows that Beethoven only wrote 9 symphonies. The policeman arrests Sandor. Meanwhile, Jeff comes to Susanswerphone to confess his love for Ella. She quits Susanswerphone in order to make a life with herself and Jeff (""I'm Going Back"").","This musical may have occurred in the way as the story goes below only at a time when there were no automated telephone companies.  Ella is a worker of one of these and connects customers with each other, listens to them talking, their lives and dreams herself of the fact that her private life would not be so dull and drab. (A lot of time will pass before people will be jealous of their privacy, to give it up after some years to exchange it for the full openness of social networks). She reflects herself being on the places of many of her clients. And she falls in love with one of them, not knowing anything about him, except of his voice.

Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas!," All the residents of Whoville (Whos) enjoy celebrating Christmas with the exception of the Grinch, a misanthropic and devious green-furred creature who hates Christmas as well as the Whos. As a result, nobody likes the Grinch due to the harmful stunts he pulls on them. Meanwhile, six-year-old Cindy Lou Who believes that everyone is missing the point about Christmas by focusing too much on the gifts and festivities and too little on the personal relationships. She then has a face-to-face encounter with the Grinch at the post office and later discovers his tragic past.Cindy learns that the Grinch arrived in Whoville as a baby and was adopted by two elderly sisters. He was a timid child who had a crush on Martha May Whovier, one of the prettiest girls in his school, who showed empathy towards him. Bully Augustus May Who, however, was jealous that Martha liked the Grinch more than him and began to mock him for having a beard. Because of this, the Grinch cut his face while attempting to shave, to which his classmates — except Martha — laughed at him and caused the Grinch to lose his temper and declare that he hates Christmas. He fled to the top of Mount Crumpit, north of Whoville, for which he lived there for the next 53 years.Touched by this story, Cindy nominates the Grinch to be the town's ""Holiday Cheermeister"", much to the displeasure of May Who, who is now the mayor of Whoville. Cindy climbs to Mount Crumpit to invite the Grinch to the celebration and he eventually accepts. As Cheermeister, the Grinch participates in several events and begins to have fun, but May Who reminds him of his childhood humiliation by giving him an electric shaver as a present before publicly proposing marriage to Martha and giving her a gaudy engagement ring. Enraged, the Grinch berates the Whos for their materialism by telling them that Christmas is only about gifts that they will end up throwing in the garbage, which is dumped on Mount Crumpit near his home. He destroys the tree and goes on a rampage around Whoville, before going back home to Mt. Crumpit.Finally fed up with the Whos' Christmas, the Grinch concocts a plan to crush the Whos' Christmas spirit by stealing all of their presents, decorations and food while they're sleeping. He disguises himself as Santa Claus and dresses his dog Max as a reindeer, then descends into Whoville. The first house he enters is Cindy's, and lies to Cindy when she catches him stealing their tree, allowing him to escape. The Grinch continues stealing all of the gifts, decorations and food and stuffing them all in a large sack, before climbing back to the top of Mt. Crumpit to destroy the gifts by pushing the sack off the side. When the Whos wake up on Christmas morning, they are horrified to discover the theft and May Who blames Cindy for letting this happen to Whoville. However, her cheerful father, town postmaster Lou Lou Who, comes to his daughter's defense by explaining to Maywho and all of the other Whos that he has finally figured out what Cindy has been trying to tell the whole town — Christmas is mainly about love of family and friends, not just gifts and fancy lights. The Whos agree with Lou and start singing Whoville's Christmas carol.Before the Grinch can push the stolen gifts off the top of Mount Crumpit, he hears the Whos singing and realizes that he has failed to prevent Christmas, but then has an epiphany and finally realizes the true meaning of Christmas, causing his heart to grow three sizes. The sleigh full of gifts begins to slide over the edge of the cliff along with Cindy, who had come to spend Christmas with him. The Grinch gets the strength to lift the loaded sleigh and carry Cindy to safety, and they ride down the mountain to return the gifts.The Grinch apologizes for the burglary and surrenders himself to the police, who accept his apology and deny May Who's request to arrest and pepper spray the Grinch. Martha even turns down May Who's proposal and returns his engagement ring to him, declaring that her heart belongs to the Grinch. Afterwards, the redeemed Grinch joins in the Whos' celebration feast and carves the roast beast himself in his cave.", 
Curtains,"  Act I It is 1959 at the Colonial Theatre in Boston, where a new musical called ""Robbin' Hood!"", a western version of Robin Hood, is reaching its conclusion (""Wide Open Spaces""). Madame Marian, played by faded film star diva Jessica Cranshaw, looks on as Robin Hood played by Bobby Pepper, wins the sharp-shooting contest and proposes to Miss Nancy, the schoolmarm, played by Niki Harris. The cast then sings the finale of the show, during which it is clear that Jessica can neither sing, dance, nor act. She takes her bow and, after receiving two bouquets, collapses behind the curtain.Later that night, Carmen Bernstein, a hard-bitten lady co-producer, divorced songwriting team Aaron Fox and Georgia Hendricks, and the show's financial backer, Oscar Shapiro, read the reviews, most of which are terrible, especially the Boston Globe's, which is the review they needed; the only good review comes from the Cambridge Patriot. No one believes that anyone would be heartless enough to become a critic (""What Kind of Man""). The show's flamboyant British director, Christopher Belling, arrives, saying that he had an epiphany after walking into a church. Just then, stage manager Johnny tells Carmen that there is a phone call for her. Carmen suspects that it's her philandering husband Sidney. Meanwhile, Georgia and Aaron get into an argument about why Georgia joined the show. Aaron claims that she only wanted to rekindle a romance with choreographer Bobby, the actor playing Rob Hood and Georgia's ex-boyfriend. Everyone is pessimistic, but Belling asks Georgia to sing Madame Marian's opening number. She does so spectacularly, and it is clear that she is thinking about her failed marriage with Aaron. Aaron begins to sing with her, but Bobby cuts him off and they finish the number together. (""Thinking of Him"").Belling then announces his plan: they are going to replace Jessica. Niki Harris, the schoolmarm and Jessica's understudy, steps forward and says she would feel terrible taking over, but Belling goes on to say that he is actually casting Georgia as Madame Marian. Bambi, the show's featured dancer, steps forward and says that Niki should get the role, but Belling sees right through her: Bambi is Niki's understudy, meaning if Niki got the lead, she'd get to play Miss Nancy. Georgia is cast, in spite of Aaron's disapproval.Carmen then enters and tells everyone that it was the hospital that had called. Jessica Cranshaw is dead. The cast performs a mock funeral, and it is clear that no one is sorry to see their leading lady gone (""The Woman's Dead""). Lt. Frank Cioffi of the Boston Police Department arrives to announce that he had seen the show and loved it (except for Cranshaw), and then reveals that Jessica Cranshaw was murdered.Cioffi tells Belling to finish up what he was doing with the cast. The ensemble tries to leave, saying that they want to quit the show. Carmen tries to convince them that ""the show must go on"", and various members of the ensemble stand up to her, including Bambi, who is actually named Elaine and is Carmen's daughter. Cioffi, an amateur performer himself, enthusiastically helps her convince them to do the show, and realize how lucky they are to be actors/actresses(""Show People""). It works and Carmen decides to treat everyone to a drink at the local bar. However, since Cranshaw was poisoned in the last minutes of the show and never left the stage thereafter, Cioffi believes that she must have been murdered by a member of the company. Also believing that the murderer is still in the building, Cioffi sequesters the building and won't let anyone leave. Sidney Bernstein, Carmen's husband, arrives from New York, and Cioffi begins to suspect him, although Sidney claims to have been with a certain woman whose name he refuses to give.Cioffi is left alone with the winsome Niki, who is now the understudy for Georgia. The lieutenant is struck by Niki's charm and confides in her about his investigation and his lonely life, as he is married to his job (""Coffee Shop Nights""). She seems to return his affection, so he hopes she is not the murderer. The next day, Georgia attempts to learn a dance from the show, but is failing miserably despite Bobby's constant belief in her. Cioffi arrives and soon meets Daryl Grady, the critic who wrote the terrible review for the Boston Globe, only praising the choreography and Niki's performance. Cioffi asks him how he got inside the theater and Grady points out that, as a member of the press, he's exempt from the quarantine. Carmen and Sidney called him in to ask him to re-review the show with Georgia as the new lead, and he decides that he will re-review the show, tomorrow. They reluctantly agree before Niki tries to thank Daryl for his kind words about her. He tells her that he doesn't associate with the artists he reviews, and, after having an argument with Cioffi about his previous review of ""Robbin' Hood"", leaves. Bobby, Belling, and Georgia enter, enraged with the fact that they have so little time to prepare for a review.Belling works to re-stage a difficult production number, featuring Niki, Georgia and Bambi. Cioffi suggests that the song needs to be rewritten (""In The Same Boat #1""). Cioffi is left alone with Aaron, who shows Cioffi the process for composing a song. After he lets it slip that he misses something, Aaron confesses that he still loves his ex-wife (""I Miss the Music""). Georgia and the cast dress rehearse the big saloon hall number (""Thataway!""). Georgia pulls it off spectacularly and everyone believes they have a shot of putting on a great show. Cioffi then comes on and tells the cast that he has figured out that Sidney has been blackmailing every member of the show into working for him. While the cast is relieved that they no longer need to be blackmailed, Cioffi reminds them they're still suspects and that they should continue with the show. Tragedy soon strikes again as the curtain is rung down, as Sidney Bernstein is simultaneously rung up, with the curtain rope tied around his neck. Act II Sasha, the conductor, turns to the audience to reveal that the hanging was fatal (""The Man is Dead""). A makeshift dormitory has been set up on the stage of the still-sequestered Colonial Theatre. Each member of the company suspects the others in the middle of the night (""He Did It""). Cioffi returns from the coroner's office and tells everyone Sid was knocked out before being tied to the rope, so everyone is still a suspect, but he focuses more on whether the show will be ready for its re-opening. When a death threat for Sidney is found, stating he will die unless he closes the show, Oscar reveals Sidney died for nothing as he was going to comply. He even gave Oscar back the last check he made out. Carmen takes it back, saying she is going to keep the show open. Aaron previews his new version of ""In the Same Boat"" featuring Bobby and two ensemble cast members, Randy and Harv. Cioffi is not yet satisfied with the product and has other advice for the show's creators (""In The Same Boat # 2"").Bambi asks that a pas de deux be added for herself and Bobby. Carmen agrees, but she is no stage mother: her duty is to the box office (""It’s a Business""). Grady then comes in and tells everyone that he's taking interviews from the cast in the Green Room. Bambi does well at the rehearsal of the re-staged square dance number (""Kansasland""). However, towards the end of the dance a shot rings out from offstage, and Bobby is wounded in the arm, although Cioffi soon figures out that Carmen was actually the target. Niki comes forward with the gun, and the company immediately jumps to the conclusion that she is guilty (""She Did It"" (Reprise)). She says that she innocently found the gun backstage and hands it over, albeit after she accidentally pulls the trigger and almost hits Cioffi.As Cioffi works on solving the case, he tells Aaron, Georgia, and Bobby that Sidney had nothing on them and yet they were still working for very little money. Georgia then quotes a death threat which Cioffi hadn't read out loud. Cioffi is about to arrest her when Aaron attempts to takes the blame for her, reviving their romance. (""Thinking of Him/I Miss the Music"" (Reprise)). After Aaron leaves it is revealed that it was all an act, and that Bobby had only been pretending to be Georgia's boyfriend so that she could see if she could stir anything in them. She leaves, and Bobby confesses that he does love Georgia, and that he would do anything for her, even commit murder.Niki laments how love makes people feel bad, but Cioffi begins flirting with her and reminisces about the first time he saw her on stage, and how he thought that he could be her perfect partner; in an elaborate fantasy sequence, he becomes just that (""A Tough Act to Follow""). But he realizes that she has a secret. He also tells Niki that some cast members were using certain people to get higher ratings, and in Sidney's book where he had coded memos for the casts' blackmails, there was an O next to her name. Stage manager Johnny knows the secret, but won't tell the detective what it is. He is shot and killed before he can reveal any more. He tears out a page from his notebook saying ""Drop in Planet Earth"".Cioffi takes Niki and Belling up to the theater's catwalk high above the stage as the cast rehearses a third version of ""In the Same Boat"" below. He announces that he's solved the mystery. Left alone, he is hit with a sandbag and is sent tumbling down. He narrowly escapes death by clutching onto a prop, which lowers him to safety. When on the ground, he exclaims that he has solved it...he knows how to best stage ""In the Same Boat"". Putting together all of the versions, the cast is able to sing an incredible number (""In The Same Boat- Completed"")With the number completed, Cioffi tells Nikki he has a plan to solve the murder and then announces that he and Niki are engaged. He then asks the cast to re-stage the bows, when Jessica was murdered, and they notice that Georgia is only being offered one bouquet, not two. Cioffi figures out that the murderer hid a pellet gun with a poison capsule inside a bouquet, disguised as an usher, and killed Jessica. Bobby suddenly comes on stage with a bloody head and collapses, and everyone realizes that the masked Rob Hood standing on stage is a fake.Cioffi then announces that the O and the ""Drop in Planet earth"" both represented a globe: The Boston Globe. He finally solves the case: the murderer is the Boston Globe critic, Daryl Grady. Grady then takes off the mask and reveals that he is in love with Niki and did not want her to move away to New York, so he decided he would do anything to stop the show. Grady then holds a knife to Niki's neck, threatening to kill her so that Cioffi can't marry her. He tells Cioffi to give him his gun, but when Grady tries to shoot Cioffi he realizes that the gun has no bullets inside. He is foiled when Cioffi takes another gun from his jacket and Carmen pulls the trapdoor on him. Cioffi's colleague Detective O'Farrell takes him into custody and the production is relieved the murder is finally solved. After everyone returns backstage to prepare for the reopening. Cioffi privately confronts Carmen: she killed Sidney. Carmen has been secretly acting on behalf of Bambi while pretending to be unsupportive so Bambi would have to work to get ahead rather than rely on nepotism. So she had always belittled Bambi in public so nobody but Carmen would know that she was supporting her daughter. She wants her daughter Bambi to move on to Broadway, but Sidney was going to close the show. Cioffi agrees to give her until after the show's Broadway opening to turn herself in, and tells her that, with the right lawyer, she could easily be acquitted of what is surely justifiable homicide. Carmen tells Cioffi that he's one of them (""Show People"" (Reprise)) Belling comes on and tells them that with Bobby's injury, he may not be ready for the performance.Finally, the show reopens. Georgia is now Madame Marian, Cioffi has replaced Bobby as Rob Hood, and ""Tough Act to Follow"" has become the new finale of the show.","The action takes place in a large industrial city where the new musical called ""Robin Hood"" is close to completion. Marian part is played by a local diva. In the course of the play, it becomes clear that she is very bad in her role. Having 2 flower balls from the audience, she quickly hides behind a curtain.  Later that evening, one of the co-producers talks to two soloists. They read the unflattering reviews from critics. Only a single review is turned to be good. All are disappointed by heatless critics.  The director reveals that he is going to replace the horrible actress with a new one to save the play. Meanwhile, participants in the histrionics are informed that there were a call from the hospital & one of the actresses died. The theater is visited by police lieutenant with the news that she was actually murdered. And also he believes that she was killed by someone from the troupe crew. And even maybe he or she is still in the building & so isolates it until everything will be considered done. Another actor comes from The Big Apple and the police begin to suspect him, even though he claims that he was with some unnamed woman. Officer was left alone with one of the actresses & has got fascinated by her & hopes that she isn’t an assassin. Then he meets a critic who wrote unflattering review on the histrionics & asks him to watch the show again, with a new leading actress. The critic praises the new work.  The lieutenant tells the actors that the producer blackmailed all the team so that they have worked for a small wages, and recalls that he still suspects all in the crime, but they should continue to play without interrupting regular exhibitions. Once, after the play ended with the final curtain, everyone see the producer hanging on the rope around his neck on stage.  All begin to suspect each other even more. New lead actress says that she will continue to develop the show. Suddenly, a shot is heard from behind the scenes: one of the men-actors was wounded in the arm, but the lieutenant discovers that shooter was a leading actress & she stands forward with a gun so everything decided that she was guilty. She admits that she had found the weapon but no more.  Lieutenant wants to arrest her, but secretly in love with her, and a member of a troupe takes the blame on himself and admits that he loves her & is ready to do anything for her, even to commit a murder. Despite the fact that the lieutenant feels sympathy for Nicky, he realizes that she is hiding something. Studio manager is also  killed, and we find as he knew something compromising. Suddenly, one of the troupe comes out with a head in blood, and everyone understand that behind the mask of Robin Hood on the scene another person hides.  Lieutenant solves the puzzle: the murderer is a critic. It turns out that he also is in love with Nicky and does not want her leaving to New York, so he tried to stop the show & she would stay here too. He takes Nicky as a hostage, promising to kill a policeman and tries to shoot, but the gun did not have bullets. The lieutenant captivates him & the show goes on, with a change in the composition of the actors."
Fosse, ,"This musical is a revue, compiled in its three acts of various dance numbers that are associated with Bob Fosse – perfect dancer, an outstanding choreographer, director, actor and screenwriter who has worked both in Broadway and in filming industry. He is distinguished by the fact that he had received 8 Tonies for choreography and 1 Oscar for his phenomenally beautiful Cabaret (and nominated for the latter-mentioned award four times) for his 60-years’ life.  The musical includes 27 music + dance numbers, divided onto 9, 8, and 10 parts in each act, respectively. Each of them has, of course, its own style. For example, from the interesting Shoeless Joe Ballet (which is a clip from one of his films), where the frame contained a crowd of baseball players dancing with a woman in a blue dress, to the Rich Man's Frug, where little black dress in sequins is the main enticing part in a style of movie and cartoon called The Pink Panther. Ballets of all staging numbers are of varying quantities as well, from a few up to almost 30 people – the whole cast. Choreography is made by Richard Maltby, Jr., among others. The other two are its creators A. Reinking & C. Walker – first was his partner till the death and second was his friend."
Xanadu," It is 1980, and chalk artist Sonny Malone is dissatisfied with his sidewalk mural of the Greek Muses (daughters of Zeus) and determines to kill himself.  On Mount Olympus, Clio (pronounced ""Kleye-o""), the youngest, perkiest Muse, convinces her six sisters (two of whom are men), to travel to Venice Beach (rising out of the sidewalk mural) to inspire Sonny (""I'm Alive""). Zeus's rules require that Muses must always be disguised from mortals. Clio has the idea to wear roller skates, leg warmers, and sport an Australian accent, and the other muses agree. Clio changes her name to something contemporary: ""Kira"".  Quickly inspired (""Magic""), Sonny decides that he can combine all the arts and ""something athletic"" all into one spectacular entertainment: a roller disco.Two of Clio's sisters, Melpomene (the oldest sister) and Calliope, are jealous that Clio (although the youngest) is the leader of the Muses and that Zeus had promised ""Xanadu"" to Clio, although no one knows exactly what that entails (""Evil Woman""). So they plot to discredit Clio and cause her banishment by tricking her into breaking one of Zeus's rules: a Muse must not fall in love with a mortal, so they will curse ""Kira"" and Sonny to fall in love.Meanwhile, Sonny finds a good location for the roller disco, a long-abandoned theater in the Fairfax district of Los Angeles called ""Xanadu.""""Kira"" inspires him to locate the owner in the phone book (""Suddenly""), and they set up a meeting with real estate mogul Danny Maguire, who used to be a big band clarinetist before he started in the real estate game.Sonny visits hard-hearted Danny in his posh office in downtown Los Angeles and tries to convince him to donate the theater for the roller disco, because it would bring the arts to the Fairfax district and drive up real estate values.  But Danny scoffs, even though he had plans to open the theater himself, once upon a time. As Sonny leaves, ""Kira"" arrives, jogging Danny's memories of an old love and dance partner of his, who looked suspiciously like ""Kira,"" named Kitty(""Whenever You're Away from Me""). Kitty tells Danny that although he had let his greed stop him from pursuing his dream to open the theater 35 years ago, he has a chance to redeem himself now by opening the roller disco with Sonny.  Danny finds Sonny and tells him that if he can get the disco up and running in one day, he'll give him 25% of the take from the Disco (""Dancin'""). Excited, Sonny readily agrees.Sonny finds ""Kira"" and tells her the good news. She is not impressed with the deal that he has cut. It is then that the evil sisters work their curse, and the winged Eros, along with ""Mama Cupid"", shoots ""Kira"" and Sonny with the arrows of love (""Strange Magic""). ""Kira"" is soon overwhelmed with guilt over her loving feelings and of having created her own art (a hand-drawn picture) alongside Sonny – both violations of Zeus's restrictions on the Muses.With the help of some of the muses, ""Kira"" and Sonny fix up the old theater (""All Over the World""), and Danny agrees to go ahead with the opening.  Clio realizes that she is falling in love with Sonny and tells him that she must leave (""Don't Walk Away""). But the evil sisters are not finished.  Now they offer Danny piles of money if he will tear down the theater and build condos. Danny can't resist and tells Sonny that the deal is off.""Kira"" comes back to tell Sonny that she loves him, but the evil sisters tell her that she has broken Zeus's rules, and that she must tell Sonny the truth.  So ""Kira"" reveals all to Sonny, including that her name is Clio, but he does not believe her and is upset.  He suggests that she is a crackpot. He also doubts that she really loves him, and she is angry and hurt (""Fool""). The evil sisters have triumphed (""The Fall""), and Kira sets off for Mount Olympus to receive her punishment from Zeus (""Suspended in Time"").Meanwhile, Sonny and Danny discuss ""Kira"" and after seeing her in the sky, it all makes sense. Danny tells Sonny not to let go of his muse because of foolish pride as he once did back in the 1940s. Sonny, realizing that he really loves ""Kira,"" decides to find her - even if it means climbing Mount Olympus.Back on Mount Olympus, Zeus's wives ask him to take pity on Clio (""Have You Never Been Mellow""). Thetis retells the story of Achilles and his vulnerable heel. All the demi-gods and demi-goddesses are so afflicted. This gives Clio an epiphany:  She, too, is invulnerable, except for her heels, but when the evil sisters had her shot with the arrows of love, she had been wearing the ""mighty legwarmers,"" and so she must have been completely invulnerable. This means that she really did love Sonny! Kira then declares her love for Sonny and rips off her legwarmers (""I'm Free"") and attempts to fly away with Pegasus and Sonny, before Zeus pulls them down with copper chains. Sonny brashly declares that he would even fight Zeus for the woman he loves. Zeus, impressed with his pluck, decides to pardon Clio. The two evil sisters are displeased, the lovers are reunited, and Zeus reveals what Xanadu is: ""True love and the ability to create and share art.""  Clio and Sonny go back to L.A. and Xanadu (""Xanadu"").","Muse Clio has decided to help her artist, staying on the verge of despair because of the failed fresco. She announced her sisters that under the guise of an ordinary girl Kira, she will inspire young man on a masterpiece. Having decided not to be different from the mortal people, muse wore roller skates and leg warmers. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, artist Sonny was trying to decide to commit suicide on a pier. Kira stopped him and returned the self-confidence. The young man told the girl of his dream to open a roller disco. When the muse returned briefly to the gods, Melpomene accused sister that she fell in love with the man and she wants to create a work of art herself. Clio has rejected it, because she knew – Zeus forbids such interference. When muse returned to the ground, Melpomene and Calliope decided to disrupt the plans of sister. They were jealous of her future reward named Xanadu, which thunderer promised to give to Clio, though no one knew what it was.  Sonny and Kira found an old theater, suitable for roller disco. Seeing that it was formerly called Xanadu, muse understood – this house was a sign from above. Meeting the owner was unsuccessful – Danny did not want to give the building to a young man. When an artist has left, Kira recalled businessman that many years ago he wanted to open the doll theater. Suddenly, Danny realized how much a girl is similar to his partner, for which he has built this building. Kira persuaded the man to give Sonny a chance to realize his dream. Having met with the artist in Xanadu, Danny agreed to provide the building if they would make an order there in one day. He also promised to give the young man 25% of future profits. Sonny asked Kira to make a drawing for the theater. Muse helped the artist, doing something herself for the first time in life. Taking advantage of the situation, Melpomene and Calliope brought love spell upon a sister. With the help of the rest of the muses, Kira was able to restore the theater.  Arriving in 24 hours, Danny said that the condition was fulfilled and now Sonny can do disco in the building. Suddenly Hermes handed Clio a message from Zeus – the muse had to return to Olympus and to answer for her misdeeds. Kira told her beloved that she had to leave. Soon she came to the fresco depicting the muses-sisters and admitted in her mistakes. Posing as a businessman engaged in the construction of real estate, Melpomene offered Danny a lot of money for the theater. After some hesitation, he agreed so the building to be demolished. When an artist came to the fresco, muse admitted that her name was Clio and she told him about her origins. Sonny thought the girl had not everything right with her head. Melpomene and Calliope said that her sister is under the spell of love right now. Clio refused to believe in the falsehood of her feelings. The artist doubted the sincerity of the muse, and they quarreled.  When the goddess left, there was Danny. Words of the sale of the theater did not touch Sonny, as he did not care anymore. Seeing Clio flying away on a winged horse, businessman realized that she was his partner many years ago. Danny rushed to rescue the theater from destruction, and the artist has decided to fight with Zeus and return the beloved. Arriving at Olympus, muse asked forgiveness for her misdeeds. Surprisingly, the spell had no effect on the Clio and she really loved Sonny. Wives of Zeus asked for leniency to the muse. When the artist came to Olympus, he called the supreme god to the battle. Zeus was struck by his courage. Clio said – she did not need immortality, she only wants to be next to Sonny. Declaring that they both received Xanadu – the ability to create and to love – thunderer let boy and girl be."

The Scarlet Pimpernel," The following is the current version, The Scarlet Pimpernel 4.0. Act 1 The play opens at La Comédie Française, an elegant theatre where Marguerite St. Just is performing in her final show (""Storybook""). As she announces to the crowd her marriage to wealthy English aristocrat Sir Percy Blakeney, Citizen Chauvelin, a fanatical agent of the French republican revolutionaries, closes the theatre before the performance is finished. Percy, Marguerite, and her brother, Armand, leave for England, and Chauvelin oversees the execution of the Marquis de St.-Cyr by guillotine in the miserable streets of Paris (""Madame Guillotine"").Percy and Marguerite wed in England (""Believe""). However, on the night of their wedding, Percy learns that his wife betrayed the Marquis de St.-Cyr, his friend, to the revolutionary government (""Wedding Dance""). Heartbroken, Percy is torn between his love for Marguerite and the knowledge of what she has done (""Prayer""). The Blakeneys' marriage grows cold.Percy determines to make amends for his friend's death by saving other innocents from the guillotine. He takes on the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel and convinces some of his friends (subsequently called ""bounders"") to join him in his daring rescue attempts; Armand insists on being included (""Into the Fire""). The band pretend to be inane fops, effectively throwing off any suspicions about the identity of the League of the Scarlet Pimpernel. Under Percy's strict orders, Marguerite is told nothing of this.Over the next five weeks, the League rescues many potential victims of the guillotine in Paris (""The Rescue""). The furious Robespierre orders Chauvelin to discover the identity of the Scarlet Pimpernel with the help of a Belgian spy named Grappin (Percy in disguise). Frustrated, Chauvelin vows to succeed (""Falcon in the Dive"").Back in England, Marie, Marguerite's old costume designer and best friend, has come to the Blakeney estate and is painting Percy's portrait. The Blakeneys' maids gossip about the Scarlet Pimpernel with Percy, who continues his foppish act (""Scarlet Pimpernel Transition""). Marguerite cannot understand how Percy is so drastically different from the man whom she married (""When I Look At You"").Informed that she has a visitor in the garden, Marguerite goes outside. Percy looks out at her in awe, yet remains confused about how he should act around her (""When I Look At You (Reprise)""). Marguerite's visitor turns out to be Chauvelin, who attempts to convince her to join him in his mission to unmask the Pimpernel, as the French believe he is a member of the Blakeneys' circle. Percy joins the conversation and perplexes Chauvelin with his ridiculous ways. When Percy leaves, Chauvelin tries to remind Marguerite of the fiery passion they once shared for the Revolution and each other (""Where's the Girl?""). Marguerite rejects Chauvelin's advances and sends him away.Armand, just returned from a trip for the League, tells Marguerite that he is going on another trip, this time to France. She becomes upset because she believes that Armand is putting himself in danger—and because he is the only one whom Marguerite feels truly loves her. Marguerite begs Armand to stay, but after trying to comfort her, he leaves, taking Marie back to Paris with him to assist the League (""You Are My Home (Reprise)"").Percy tells his remaining men that the Prince of Wales, suspicious of their trips to France, wants to meet with them. To allay the Prince's suspicions, Percy shows the League how it is a man's duty to dress elegantly and flamboyantly, and they all display the latest fashion (""The Creation of Man""). At the palace, the League convinces the Prince that they have nothing to do with the Pimpernel's activities.Chauvelin arrives to meet with the Prince but is brushed aside so that the League can help the Prince select his attire for the royal ball that night. Having received a note from Chauvelin, Marguerite meets him the palace, and Chauvelin once again enlists her aid. Armand has been captured in France, and Chauvelin threatens to have him guillotined if Marguerite refuses to help find the Pimpernel (""Marguerite's Dilemma""). Both Marguerite and Chauvelin wonder if they can trust each other; Percy finds them talking and wonders if he, too, can trust his wife (""The Riddle""). Act 2 At the Prince's ball, Percy and the other guests discuss the Pimpernel, who they all know is there that evening (""The Scarlet Pimpernel""). Percy then recites a poem he has created in honour of the Pimpernel, and the guests join in (""They Seek Him Here"").Marguerite, desperate, convinces one of Percy's men to ask the Pimpernel to meet her on the footbridge at one o'clock (""The Gavotte""). She informs Chauvelin of the plan and goes to the footbridge. Percy comes but remains hidden in the shadows, keeping his identity concealed. Marguerite tells him of Chauvelin's plans and explains that she betrayed the Marquis de St.-Cyr under coercion. Torn, Marguerite begs the Pimpernel to escape before Chauvelin arrives, but the Pimpernel promises to save Armand and sends Marguerite away. Overjoyed, Percy now understands why he has loved Marguerite all along—and that she has always remained the same (""She Was There""). Chauvelin arrives, but Percy's antics fluster him into leaving without discovering the Pimpernel's identity. The League then sets out for France to save Armand.Still unaware of the Pimpernel's identity, Marguerite does the same. Disguised as a tart, Marguerite attempts to uncover information about her brother, but she is quickly recognized and apprehended by Chauvelin (""Storybook (Reprise)""). While Chauvelin admires Marguerite's courageous efforts, he is angry that she was defying his threats, and he sends her to prison with Armand.Unable to get access to Marguerite and Armand, Grappin poses a plot to Chauvelin to have Armand lead them to the secret harbor that the League uses, where they can capture the entire group. Grappin tries to convince Chauvelin to let him dispose of Marguerite, but Chauvelin orders him to stick to the plan. Alone, Chauvelin rages over his failure to win Marguerite back (""Where's the Girl? (Reprise)"").The League meets with Percy, Marie, and Tussaud (Marie's fiancé) in Paris to try to find a way to save Marguerite and Armand. Unable to get close to them, even disguised as Grappin, Percy starts to think the situation is almost hopeless. He vows to go it alone, not wanting the rest of the League to continue to risk themselves, but they reassuredly state they will stand by him (""Into the Fire (Reprise)"").In prison, Armand assures Marguerite that the Pimpernel will save them. Refusing to believe it, Marguerite mourns the loss of Percy and of her life (""I'll Forget You""). However, the two are ""rescued"" by ""League members"" and set off for the League's harbor at the coastal town of Michelon, having no idea that Chauvelin is on their trail. On the way, Marguerite learns her husband's secret identity.At Michelon, Marguerite and Armand discover that a guillotine has been erected at the harbour. Chauvelin and his soldiers arrive, and when Marguerite desperately calls for Percy to run, Chauvelin finally begins to suspect who his adversary truly is.Grappin turns up and informs Chauvelin that the Pimpernel—who Grappin confirms is Sir Percy Blakeney—is heading for Calais. Chauvelin sends some of his men off to intercept the Pimpernel but still keeps soldiers to assist him. When Percy ""accidentally"" lets his identity slip, he and Chauvelin duel. Marguerite steps in several times to help Percy, but Chauvelin still wins (""The Duel""). Percy is then immediately guillotined.Confident in his triumph, Chauvelin sends most of his remaining soldiers away to carry the news to Robespierre, leaving only a small squad. However, to Chauvelin's utter bewilderment, Percy stands up from the guillotine unharmed. The head that fell is, in fact, a wax one that Marie (who, having married Tussaud, is revealed to be Marie Tussaud) created to fool Chauvelin. The whole duel and execution was but a ruse to lull Chauvelin into a sense of overconfidence and send the majority of his forces away. The remaining soldiers turn out to be the League in disguise.Percy's men tie up Chauvelin and leave him with planted evidence incriminating him as the Scarlet Pimpernel. Percy, Marguerite, Armand, and the bounders then set off for England. Marguerite and Percy confide in each other the true love that they have always had for each other (""Finale/When I Look At You (Reprise)"").","In the midst of Great French Revolution, actress Marguerite fell in love with Sir Percy & agreed to marry him. Soon the actress announced their intention to public. Hearing this, Chauvelin – former lover of Marguerite – was infuriated. Being a revolutionary, he hated the aristocrats. In the night of Percy’s, the actress’ & her brother’s departure, Chauvelin using blackmail forced the woman to tell about the Marquis de St.-Cyr – he was a friend of the groom of Marguerite. Soon nobleman & his family were executed. After the wedding, Percy heard that Marguerite was involved in the death of de St.-Cyr. The relationship between the spouses began to chill.  The Englishman decided to right the wrongs committed by his wife. He gathered companions of noblemen to fight with the French revolutionary authorities. Percy took the pseudonym ‘The Scarlet Pimpernel’. For the removal of the possible tail, aristocrats spent their time in seemingly carefree fun. When the participants of ‘The Scarlet Pimpernel’ League saved a lot of Frenchmen, Chauvelin decided to expose these secret helpers. Marguerite did not understand why her husband had changed so much after the wedding – a secret activity of Percy was concealed from a woman. Suddenly in England came Chauvelin. He tried to make the actress help him in finding the League’s supporters, but Marguerite refused to cooperate with the officer. Soon Percy knew about their meeting. Now he was sure that his wife cannot be trusted. & yet, the man continued to secretly love Marguerite.  Soon, Percy & his friends were invited to the royal palace. Nobles persuaded the Prince that their trips to France only needed to buy laces & having entertainment. In such way, they avoided the suspicion of involvement in the League. Chauvelin once again came to Marguerite. He told the actress that her brother was arrested as a member of the League & he could face the death penalty. The officer demanded that the woman exposed the Scarlet. Otherwise Armand would die. At the Royal ball, Marguerite asked her friend Percy to arrange a meeting with the Scarlet. Saw her masked husband, the woman admitted that she was blackmailed by Chauvelin, who demanded to reveal the identity of the leader of the League. The actress pleaded Scarlet to save Armand. Percy was happy to know that his wife was just a victim of circumstances. Soon, the Englishman with his comrades went to save Armand. Marguerite also secretly went to Paris.  The woman tried to secretly obtain information about her brother, but Chauvelin revealed her & the actress was thrown into prison. The officer decided that he would execute his former lover. Suddenly, Armand helped Marguerite to get out of the jail. When they went on members’ of the League meeting, they exposed a place to Chauvelin, who organized Marguerite’s escape to follow her. Marguerite learned the secret of her husband. Percy struggled with the officer at swords & lost him. Soon the head of the Englishman was cut down on a guillotine. Chauvelin sent troops to report on the execution of the Scarlet. Surprisingly, it was found out that Percy was alive – on the scaffold was his wax replica. The remaining soldiers with the official were supporters of the League. Binding Chauvelin, they placed beside him many evidences pointed to the fact that the official himself was the Pimpernel. Then Percy, Marguerite & Armand with his friends went home."

Dogfight,"  Act One In 1967, Eddie Birdlace, a U.S. Marine just returned from Vietnam, rides a Greyhound bus heading for San Francisco. As he travels through the night, he remembers Rose Fenny (""Prelude: Take Me Back"") and the night he spent in San Francisco four years earlier. Memories overwhelm him and suddenly it is November 21, 1963.The Greyhound bus becomes a military bus, carrying Private First Class Birdlace and his rowdy fellow Marines, fresh out of training and ready for action. Arriving in San Francisco, they are eager to take the town by storm on their last night in the United States (""Some Kinda Time""). Birdlace and his two best friends, Boland and Bernstein, who call themselves the Three Bees (""We Three Bees""), are participating in a dogfight, a cruel game with simple rules. Each Marine puts $50 in the pot. The one who brings the ugliest date to the party wins the money. Birdlace and his friends set off to scour the city for potential dates (""Hey Good-Lookin'"").Birdlace ends up in a diner, where he sees Rose, a shy waitress, quietly playing guitar in a corner booth. He flirts with her, eventually inviting Rose to be his date (""Come to a Party""). Not knowing the true purpose of the evening, she is excited to go on her first date. She tears items from her closet, searching for the perfect dress (""Nothing Short of Wonderful""). Meanwhile, other Marines find their dates, including Boland, who breaks the established rules of the dogfight by inviting Marcy, a wisecracking, near-toothless prostitute eager to win a share of the cash prize that comes with being deemed the ugliest date (""Come to a Party (Reprise)"").As Birdlace and Rose walk to the party, she is chatty, revealing her folk music aspirations and her burgeoning pacifism. When they reach the Nite Lite, a club rented for the party, Birdlace finds himself questioning his plan to subject her to the event. He suggests they go somewhere else and get a bite to eat. Rose believes his change of heart means he is embarrassed by her, that he does not want his friends to meet her. Conflicted, Birdlace acquiesces and they enter the party.At the table with his friends and their dates, Birdlace drinks heavily and grows sour. He tries unsuccessfully to keep Rose off the dance floor during the slow dance, when the contest is officially judged. As they dance, each Marine presents his date for judging (""That Face""). It is determined that Marcy is the ugliest, crowning Boland the big winner. Later, in the ladies room, Marcy reveals to Rose the true nature of the party (""Dogfight""). A distraught Rose returns to Birdlace. She is furious and deeply hurt and slaps him hard across the face. ""I hope there's a war and you get killed,"" she tells him, before escaping in shame. Back home in her bedroom, surrounded by rejected dresses and dashed hopes, Rose beats herself up for having believed Birdlace's lies (""Pretty Funny""). Act Two The Marines, reckless and invincible, continue their debaucherous last night with a trip to the arcade and then by visiting a prostitute (""Hometown Hero's Ticker Tape Parade""). But Birdlace cannot bring himself to revel like his friends do. Feeling terrible about how he treated Rose, he leaves them and goes to her. He apologizes as best he can and offers to make it up to her by taking her out to a fancy dinner. At first incredulous, Rose sees Birdlace's apology, though misguided and inarticulate, is in fact genuine. She consents to the date, demanding they never again discuss the dogfight ritual and its indignities. They cautiously set out on their date (""First Date, Last Night"").At a swanky restaurant, Rose challenges Birdlace's tough exterior and cuts through his posturing, lies, and bravado. They share a meal and inch closer to understanding each other. Later, they take in the late-night view from the Golden Gate Bridge. Rose tells Birdlace that, despite its unpleasantness, what happened earlier that night has helped her to a new understanding. She can no longer allow herself to be defined by what other people think of her (""Before It's Over""). In the remaining hours before Birdlace must report and ship out, Rose nervously invites him home with her. They share an awkward and romantic first sexual experience (""Give Way"").The next morning Birdlace returns to his buddies and the world of casual cruelty that shaped him (""Some Kinda Time (Reprise)""). The Marines head overseas, where they will be pawns in the growing Vietnam War. Birdlace sees his friends, including Boland and Bernstein, killed in action. These harsh memories linger as Birdlace arrives in San Francisco in 1967, a broken, confused, lost man, unwelcome and derided (""Come Back""). Birdlace makes his way through the changed city to find an older, wiser Rose at the diner. Compassionate as ever, she welcomes him home (""Finale: Take Me Back"").", 
Applause,"  Act One Middle-aged actress Margo Channing presents the Tony Award to rising star Eve Harrington, who graciously thanks ""my producer, my director, my writer and above all, Margo Channing"". In flashback, Margo recalls the opening night for one of her plays a year-and a-half before, when Eve entered her life. Margo's admirers crowd her dressing room and fill the air with ""Backstage Babble"". Among the admirers is Eve, a young woman who says that she, alone and friendless in New York, has found solace in watching her hero, Margo, perform. As soon as Margo can be alone with Bill Sampson, her director and fiancé, she tries to convince him to stay with her and not go to Rome to direct a movie. Bill firmly but lovingly tells her goodbye (""Think How It's Gonna Be""). Margo dreads facing the opening night party alone, and, wanting to have a good time, she persuades, Duane, her gay hairdresser, to take her and Eve to a gay nightclub in Greenwich Village (""But Alive""). The lively evening ends back at Margo's apartment. Eve declares that it has been the best time she's ever had (""The Best Night of My Life""). Margo, seeing her 19-year-old self in one of her old movies on TV, senses the impact her increasing age will have on her career and sarcastically asks ""Who's That Girl?"".Four months later, Eve has become Margo's indispensable assistant, impressing Margo's close friends, including her producer, Howard Benedict. Howard takes Eve to a ""gypsy"" hangout. ""Gypsy,"" Howard explains,""is the name dancers affectionately give themselves as they go camping from show to show."" The ""gypsies"", led by one of their own, Bonnie, celebrate ""the sound that says love"" – ""Applause"". That night, at three a.m. after a phone call from Bill in Rome, Margo longingly wishes he would ""Hurry Back"". Bill arranges to hurry back two weeks later, but at Margo's welcome home party for him a misunderstanding leads to a disastrous evening (""Fasten Your Seat Belts""). Eve, as Margo's ever-present assistant, knows Margo's part in the play completely, and Eve contrives to get herself hired as Margo's understudy. Margo, feeling betrayed and threatened, faces Eve with an ironic ""Welcome to the Theatre"". Bill accuses her of being paranoid about Eve, and after a bitter fight, he says goodbye to Margo, ending his relationship with her. Margo is left alone on an empty stage. Act Two Margo is visiting her friends, playwright Buzz Richards and his wife Karen, in their Connecticut home. Karen, thinking Margo behaved unfairly to Eve, arranges for Margo to miss a performance by draining the car's gas tank so they cannot return to New York in time for the evening's performance. Stuck in the country for the night, they express their warm feelings as ""Good Friends"". Back in New York, Eve gives a triumphant performance in Margo's role. Howard again takes Eve to the ""gypsy"" hangout where she snubs Bonnie and her friends, who do a scathing parody of a girl who becomes an overnight star (""She's No Longer a Gypsy"").Margo is devastated when she reads a nasty interview that Eve has given in which she refers to ""aging stars."" Bill now realizes what Eve's true intentions are and rushes back full of love for Margo, telling her she's ""One of a Kind"". Margo, though, is too focused on her career to want to return to Bill. Eve, who has made an unsuccessful pass at Bill, ensnares the playwright, Buzz, and she rejoices that she now has a man who can help her career (""One Hallowe'en""). Her plans with Buzz are crushed by Howard who claims her for himself, telling her ""We both know what you want and you know I'm the one who can get it for you"" – Eve needs Howard's influence as a producer as well as his silence concerning her devious rise to stardom.Margo seems to have lost everything because of Eve, but suddenly she realizes she could be the winner because she now has a chance at ""Something Greater"" – a life with Bill. In the finale, she and Bill join with everybody answering the question ""why do we live this crazy life?"" – ""Applause"".","Margo Channing. Around her, as around the pivot, the whole plot revolves. It is a character that is typical for Broadway and for the theater’s world in general – superlative theater actress, who is very smart, talented, charming, beautiful, and in general is in her heydays. In few words, at the top. Not wanting to even think about that someday will be the sunset. She is now bathed in the glory and admiration of all around, being the most powerful person in her environment.  The musical tells about show business and that scene should be a place where a true actor feels as comfortable as possible. As one of the participants of the world of the theater told, the scene – is a place where the real actor wants to die. Margot, according to the scenario, rushes to the stage where the actors rehearse their upcoming performance, and arranges small brawl, because her shortcomings are as big as her pluses. She is unbalanced, narcissistic, self-centered, but at the same time, is afraid that her future husband, who plays the role of the director of this show inside of the show going on stage, the balanced and nice person, will not take her as wife because of age – in fact she is already 40.  Eve Harrington plays a comely and selfless girl (at the beginning), the exact opposite of Margo, whom she admires, because once upon a time Margo saved her from the endless melancholy and unwillingness to live, by showing that life can be bright and emotional. As it turns out later, Eve is not so nice, but very heavy, because she with time captures with her charm all close people to Margo. The latter, in retaliation sharpens the teeth and claws on Eve and shows all her furious nature.  The second act reveals the true soul of Eve gradually, as she is seeking the replacement of Margo on scene, and all the critics admired her acting. She admires herself and it turns out that she is very arrogant person. She charms the producer and the stage assistant, and even tries to openly steal the groom of Margo, the director of the play. In the song One Halloween, she further reveals herself when singing, with a line that no one cares how you reached the top when you're already there.  Producer discovers that the past of Eve was not so tragic as she told everyone and so she much be in his bed only, instead of being jumped to other influential people’s beds in the theater to go on top, threatening her that otherwise she will not play in the theater at all. Eve agrees and Margo finally understands the transience of life and the zero price of public admire."
Kismet," Kismet is set in a fictional Baghdad in the times of The Arabian Nights. Act 1 At a mosque, an imam prays as the sun rises (""The Sands of Time""). Three beggars sit outside the temple, but the fourth, Hajj, has gone to Mecca.  Crying ""Rhymes! Fine Rhymes!"", a poet enters to sell his verses. His beautiful daughter Marsinah joins in the sales pitch, but they have no success (""Rhymes Have I""). Marsinah is sent to steal oranges in the Bazaar for their breakfast, while her father sits down to beg. When the beggars object to the poet's taking Hajj's place, he claims to be a cousin of Hajj.  The poet threatens to curse those who do not give him money and soon earns a few coins (""Fate"").  Hassen-Ben, a huge man from the desert, mistakes him for Hajj and kidnaps him.  The poet (who is referred to as Hajj thereafter) is taken to Jawan, a notorious brigand.  Fifteen years ago, the real Hajj had placed a curse on Jawan that resulted in the disappearance of the brigand's little son. Now he wants the curse removed. The new Hajj, seeing an opportunity to make some money, promises to do so for 100 gold pieces. Jawan leaves for Baghdad to search for his son, and Hajj rejoices in his new-found riches (""Fate"" (reprise)).Back in the city, the wazir of police comes through the busy bazaar (""Bazaar of the Caravans""). The evil wazir and his seductive, beautiful wife-of-wives, Lalume, discuss a loan he desperately needs. In return for the money lent from the king of Ababu, the caliph must marry one (or all three) of the princesses of Ababu, who perform a sexy dance. Through their amah, the princesses tell Lalume that they wish to return home. Lalume convinces them that Baghdad is much more exciting than any other place on earth (""Not Since Nineveh"").Marsinah is being pursued by a fruit merchant whose wares she has stolen.  Her father arrives to rescue her, giving the man money.  Hajj gives his daughter half of the money and leaves. The merchants set out their finest ""Baubles, Bangles and Beads"" for the young lady.  The young caliph and his advisor, Omar Khayyam, have been traveling incognito. He is struck by Marsinah's beauty and follows her.  Elsewhere, Hajj is basking in the glow of some scantily-dressed slave girls he has just bought, when he is stopped by the police, who are checking identities because they are looking for Jawan. The Chief recognizes, on the coins, the crest of a family Jawan has robbed and arrests Hajj as a thief.  Meanwhile, Marsinah has found a quaint little house with a beautiful garden to buy for her father and herself. She is admiring the garden when the Caliph slips in and, pretending to be a gardener, introduces himself to her. They fall in love on the spot (""Stranger in Paradise"").  They promise to meet again in the garden at moonrise.  The Caliph tells Omar that he has fallen in love, which is overheard by the princesses of Ababu; they are furious that he seems to ignore them, but the Chief Policeman reassures them that ""He's in Love"".At the wazir's palace, Hajj is on trial for the theft of 100 pieces of gold. The wazir has no need for evidence; he sentences Hajj to 20 lashes, and his right hand is to be cut off.  The poet pleads that, as a poet and storyteller, the loss of a hand would cripple his career; it is the gesture that tells the story (""Gesticulate"").  The lovely Lalume, attracted to the handsome poet, begs her husband for forgiveness, but the Wazir is not convinced and orders his guards to drag Hajj off to punishment.  As Hajj curses the wazir, a guard bursts in with news that they have captured Jawan.  The old brigand is brought in and asks Hajj where his son is.  He sees, around the wazir's neck, a medallion that his son was wearing when he was captured. The wazir is his son! Jawan praises the power of the great magician, Hajj, a man who has the power to curse and uncurse.  Jawan is thrilled to see his son, but the Wazir sentences his own father to death. ""For the leading judge of Mesopotamia to have as a father the leading criminal of Mesopotamia,"" he says, is ""a disturbing thought.""As Jawan is led to his execution, the wazir realizes that the ""powerful magician"" has cursed him. Just when he is about to murder Hajj, the caliph enters with news that he has found a bride, a commoner, and that he will marry her tonight.  The wazir is distraught: if the caliph does not marry a princess of Ababu, the wazir will be ruined.  He concludes that this is a result of Hajj's curse and begs Hajj to reverse the situation, promising him a reprieve and the title of Emir. Hajj agrees. Lalume knows that the poet is no wizard, but she decides that he may be her chance out of a dull life (""Bored"") and is falling in love with him; she promises to help.  When the wazir returns, Hajj sings a mystic-sounding invocation to fate as the slave-girls dance wildly, distracting the wazir. Hajj jumps out of a window, leaving his coat behind him. When the wazir sees he is gone, he clutches the cloak in amazement and faints. Act 2 The caliph and his wedding procession approach the house of his beloved (""Night of my Nights""). Inside, Marsinah thinks only of her gardener (""Stranger in Paradise"" (reprise)). Hajj enters and tells her of his situation and says that they must flee immediately to Damascus, but Marsinah refuses to go. They argue, and he nearly strikes her before he runs off, ashamed.  She departs in the opposite direction. When the caliph enters the garden, his love is not there.The wazir is informed by his spies that the caliph's bride has disappeared.  He rejoices at the power he wields, by having a magician as Emir (""Was I Wazir?""). He instructs Lalume to keep his new Emir happy, and she is eager to comply (""Rahadlakum"").  Hajj and Lalume are discussing a trip to a ""small oasis, a week's travel by camel"" when Marsinah enters the Harem.  Father and daughter reconcile, and she tells him of her lover and asks him to find him.  At the same time, the caliph, in the next room, orders the wazir to find his love (""And This Is My Beloved"").   Hajj and Omar encounter each other and engage in a battle of wits (""The Olive Tree"").The wazir, hoping to convince the caliph that only wanting one wife is just a phase, shows him his harem through a peephole where he sees Marsinah. The caliph is horrified that his love is a member of the wazir's Harem, and the wazir, sure that Hajj has arranged the whole thing, claims that she is one of his wives. The caliph, heartbroken, agrees to choose his wife-of-wives that night during his diwan.  So as not to have lied to his prince, the wazir immediately marries Marsinah, promising to visit her that night. She vows to kill herself if he does.That night, at the caliph's diwan, the candidates for his hand dance for him: Princess Zubbediya of Damascus, Princess Samaris of Bangalore, and the three Ababu princesses. The caliph is unmoved.  Hajj is searching for Marsinah; the wazir thanks the ""wizard"" for placing the caliph's beloved in his own harem. Laughing, he tells him that he has married the pretty little Marsinah.  Realizing what has happened, Hajj pulls a knife, but has a better idea. He takes a blank plaque and throws it in a pool, proclaiming that when it is retrieved, it will read the name of the caliph's fated bride. He secretly gives the wazir another tablet, this one with the name Ababu written on it, and tells him to substitute it for the tablet from the pool.  When the wazir enters the pool, Hajj trips him and holds him underwater until he drowns.Hajj explains all to the caliph, who is joyfully reunited with Marsinah. The caliph is ready to pardon Hajj for his murder of a public official, but the poet requests, as his punishment, to be ""banished to some dreadful oasis ... at least a week's journey away by camel,"" and to be made to comfort the wazir's widow in her ""grief"". As the two couples unite, the poet reflects on the fleetingness of ""The Sands of Time"".","Fate is one of the immutable things. Everyone, even the smallest one, can give more or less clear idea of this notion. “This is fate” – here & there you can hear such explanation of any event. But more often – of incredible turns in human lives. This skein of fate begins at the East. Three beggars sitting near the mosque & ask for alms. In their talks, they constantly mention the fourth one, whose name is Hajj. He recently left them to go to Mecca. At the same time, near the mosque sits beggar-poet trying to sell his poems. Along with him is his beautiful daughter Marsinah. The poet suffers defeat after defeat, because nobody wants his poems. & then he sees the other beggars.  The man sits down close to them, overhearing their conversations before & he names himself as a cousin of Hajj, being called by the same name. By cunning, he earns a few coins, threatening to all pass-by people, that if they did not leave him alms, he would curse them. & it would be nice, but the new Hajj is spotted by famous thief named Jawan. He is furious & demands from Hajj to remove his curse, which he allegedly imposed on Jawan many years ago, after which his young son was missing.  The poet was no fool. He spotted an opportunity to earn extra money & put the robber a condition: a hundred gold coins in exchange for the removal of curse. Jawan keeps his word & gives the poet hundred gold coins & then went to Baghdad to finally find his long-ago lost son. Hajj met his daughter & gives her half of the amount, so that she could spend the money on own needs & they separate on the market. The same day, in the city there is the vizier of the Caliph with his first wife, the beautiful Lalume. They discuss the bad plight of the vizier, who took money from the ruler in exchange for the marriage of the Caliph on at least one of his daughters, which will be presented at the upcoming reception.  The young Caliph walks across the market, together with his advisor Omar, when between rows notices Marsinah. He is fascinated by her beauty, and, having escaped from the attention of the counselor, walks behind her, until finally catches her up nearby the house, which a girl selected for herself & her father. Caliph slips into the garden behind her, saying that he was a gardener. They fall in love almost immediately & agree to meet at the same place later. Meanwhile, the guards noticed that on the coins for which Hajj buys provisions, is an emblem of Jawan house, known robber & take him to submit to the court of vizier. Vizier do not need any proof of guilt or innocence, he immediately made a Hajj sentence of lashes & amputation of the right hand, but a cunning poet is unhappy with the whole idea, arguing that he is the poet & storyteller & both hands are essential for him. The wife of Vizier, conquered by Hajj, convinces her husband to spare him. But the vizier is adamant: he appoints more strikes to a poet, during which he curses a vizier. And then the guards run in, reporting that they have arrested Jawan.  Rogue bursts into the House of the Vizier & recognizes in him his son, who immediately orders to execute his newfound father, explaining that he is the leading judge & he shall not be the son of the leading criminal. After the execution of the sentence, Vizier realizes that he obviously, is really cursed & wants to proceed the execution of the poet, as the Caliph breaks in with the news that he had found himself a wife & the reception of other princesses may be canceled. Vizier, in horror & delight, offers to Hajj a position of emir & Hajj agrees. The poet does not know yet that the Caliph chose his daughter to be his bride & the cunning Vizier prevents the meeting of the Caliph & Marsinah, lying to the Caliph, that the girl is just his new concubine. But Hajj destroys all greedy & dishonest Vizier’s plans, returning beloved to each other & removing Vizier from the way to receive the gratitude of happy ruler."

Soon she finds out she is pregnant, but she can barely afford to raise another child - these early events spark the first of several ""Marilyn Monroe"" and ""dancing"" themes songs which Mrs. Johnstone sings, reflecting on the events which are occurring in her life.  The first song describes her marriage- her husband, flirted with her at a dance, and they embarked on what was supposed to be a whirlwind romance, but Mrs. Johnstone fell pregnant soon after they started dating, forcing them to get married.  She found herself pregnant again only months after the birth of their first child, and this has obviously occurred several times, as she is now pregnant for the eighth time.Mrs. Lyons is desperate for a baby but is unable to conceive, and would like to adopt a child but her husband, who is away on business overseas, is not keen on the idea. Mrs. Johnstone finds out that she is going to have twins and explains to Mrs. Lyons that she cannot afford to raise two more babies. Mrs. Lyons then suggests that Mrs. Johnstone gives one of the babies to her (""My Child""). Mrs. Johnstone apprehensively agrees to this and is made to swear on the Bible to keep to the deal. Mrs. Johnstone has the twins, and names the two children Michael (known as Mickey throughout the play) and Edward, but then regrets having agreed to give one away (""Easy Terms""). After keeping her deal with Mrs. Lyons, she lies to her other children, saying that the other baby had died and gone to heaven.Mrs. Johnstone continues to work for the rich family, but Mrs. Lyons soon feels that Mrs. Johnstone is paying too much attention to the child that she has given up to her. She fires Mrs. Johnstone, who wants to take the baby with her. Mrs. Lyons offers her money which Mrs. Johnstone refuses but Mrs. Lyons plays on Mrs. Johnstone's superstitions by telling her that ""if twins separated at birth learn that they were once one of a pair they will both immediately die"" (""Shoes Upon the Table""). Mrs. Lyons again gives Mrs. Johnstone the money and leaves.In about 1970, Mickey, the son of Mrs. Johnstone, meets Edward, the other twin, by chance, and after learning they share the same birthday, the two boys make a pact to become blood brothers, with Mickey calling Edward ""Eddie"".

Later in the day, Mickey goes to Eddie's house, but Mrs. Lyons throws him out when she comes to the realization that he is Edward's separated twin. She and Eddie argue on the subject, and Eddie swears at her. Mrs. Lyons slaps him and immediately regrets her reaction. She realises that he has learned to swear from Mickey.Mickey is playing with some neighbourhood children including his friend Linda. Afterwards, he takes her to see Eddie, and the three of them sneak off to play, but are caught by a police officer when about to throw stones through a window. Mrs. Lyons becomes worried about Eddie's friendship with Mickey, as she has started to believe the superstition that she herself had made up. She decides to move and persuades her husband, who realizes she is becoming ill and the sees the effect the poorer children are having on his son. When Eddie says goodbye, Mrs. Johnstone gives him a locket with a picture of herself and Mickey, and the boys separate.Soon afterwards, the Johnstone family are rehoused from the condemned inner city slum area of Liverpool to a new council house in the nearby overspill town of Skelmersdale (""Bright New Day"").

Mickey, distraught over Eddie and Linda's 'affair,' grabs the gun that Sammy hid before he got arrested and then storms down to the council offices to confront Eddie (""Madman"").There, Eddie is giving a speech when Mickey storms in with the gun. Mickey asks why Eddie would take away the one good thing that Mickey had – Linda. Eddie denies this intention, and the police enter, demanding that Mickey put the gun down. Mrs. Johnstone runs in and, in an attempt to stop Mickey from shooting Eddie, tells the two brothers the truth. Mickey despairs that he was not the one given away, because then he could have had the life given to Eddie. Mickey, distraught, gestures carelessly with the gun towards Eddie. The gun goes off killing Eddie, with the police then shooting and killing Mickey. Mrs Lyons's superstitious prediction has come true, and the narrator questions whether class was more to blame than superstition (""Tell Me It's Not True"").","A certain house cleaner who works for a wealthy couple already has a few children, but learns that she is pregnant again.

Suessical the Musical," This synopsis describes the tour version of the show, currently being licensed as ""Seussical the Musical"" by Music Theatre International (MTI). Act I The show opens on a bare stage, save for an odd red-and-white-striped hat in the center. A small boy wanders into view and notices the hat, wondering to whom it might belong. He finally mentions the Cat in the Hat, who appears before the Boy and tells him he has been brought to life by the Boy's ""Thinks"". The Cat creates the ""Seussian"" world and characters around the boy and himself (""Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!""), then reveals he is about to tell a story about someone as imaginative as the Boy is.To begin the story, the Cat encourages the Boy to think up the Jungle of Nool, where Horton the Elephant is bathing. Horton hears a strange noise coming from a nearby speck of dust, and reasons that someone must be on it, calling out for help. He carefully places the speck on a soft clover and decides to guard it (""Horton Hears a Who""), but is mocked mercilessly by the Sour Kangaroo and the other animals of the jungle, who do not believe him (""Biggest Blame Fool""). The only exceptions are Horton's bird neighbors, Gertrude McFuzz, who admires his compassion, and Mayzie LaBird, who is more concerned about herself.Horton soon discovers that the speck is actually a microscopic planet populated by creatures called Whos. The citizens of Who-ville introduce themselves and their yearly Christmas pageant directed by their friend the Grinch, but also reveal that in addition to being unable to control where the speck flies, they are on the brink of war and their entire population of Truffula Trees has been cut down (""Here on Who""). The Whos thank Horton and ask for his protection, and he agrees to guard their planet.At this point, the Cat pushes the Boy into the story; he becomes Jojo, the son of the Mayor of Who-ville and his wife. Jojo has been getting into trouble at school for having Thinks, so his parents order him to ""take a bath and go to bed, and think some normal Thinks, instead."" Jojo blames the Cat for getting him into trouble and tries to send him away. The Cat refuses and persuades Jojo to imagine the tub is McElligot's Pool (""It's Possible""). Jojo inadvertently floods the house, leading the Mayor and his wife to contemplate what to do with their son (""How to Raise a Child""). When the Cat hands them a brochure, they decide to send Jojo to a military school run by General Genghis Khan Schmitz, who is preparing to go to war with those who eat their bread with the butter side down (""The Military""). While there, Jojo meets Horton, and finds a mutual friend in him (""Alone in the Universe"").Gertrude, meanwhile, has fallen in love with Horton, but is afraid he does not notice her because of her own tail, which consists of only ""one droopy-droop feather"" (""The One Feather Tail of Miss Gertrude McFuzz""). At the advice of Mayzie, whose tail is enormous and dazzling, she consumes pills which make her tail grow new feathers. Gertrude is so excited that she overdoses, causing her tail to grow long and unwieldy (""Amayzing Mayzie""/""Amazing Gertrude"").Horton is ambushed by the Wickersham brothers, a gang of delinquent monkeys, who steal the clover and make off with it (""Monkey Around""). Horton gives chase until the Wickershams hand the clover to an eagle named Vlad Vladikoff, who drops it into a large patch of identical clovers (""Chasing the Whos""). Here, the Cat cuts briefly into the action to remind the audience how lucky they are to not be Horton (""How Lucky You Are""). Undeterred, Horton begins to look for the clover, hoping the Whos are still alive, when Gertrude catches up with him and tries to get him to notice her new tail. Horton is too busy, so she leaves to take more pills (""Notice Me, Horton"").Horton is about to search his three millionth clover when he loses hope. Mayzie, sitting in a nearby tree, offers to help him forget about the Whos by hatching an egg that she is too lazy to care for (""How Lucky You Are (Reprise)""). Horton reluctantly agrees, and Mayzie leaves for a vacation. Horton sits through months of harsh weather as he tries to decide between the egg and the Whos (""Horton Sits on the Egg"") before he is captured by hunters, who take him away along with the entire tree. Gertrude tries to stop the hunters, but cannot fly due to her heavy tail.The Cat closes the act with a reprise of ""How Lucky You Are"", and conducts the band during the intermission. Act II Horton, still hatching the egg, is auctioned off to the traveling Circus McGurkus (""Egg, Nest, and Tree""/""Circus McGurkus""/""How Lucky You Are (Reprise)""). At one show in Palm Beach, he meets up with Mayzie, who insists that he keep the egg for himself before leaving (""Amayzing Horton""). Horton mourns the loss of the Whos and Jojo, but vows just as surely to protect the egg, as it, too, is alone without its mother (""Alone in the Universe (Reprise)""), and sings it a lullaby with Jojo about a magical place called Solla Sollew. At the same time, the Mayor and his wife begin to miss Horton and Jojo, and wish for Solla Sollew, as well (""Solla Sollew"").Jojo is with General Schmitz and his platoon as the Butter Battle commences. Jojo deserts Schmitz, but sprints into a minefield and vanishes in an explosion. Schmitz assumes the worst and heads to Who-ville to tell Jojo's parents that their son has died. The Cat returns to perform a re-enactment of the dramatic scene. But in reality, Jojo has survived, but is lost with no idea of where to turn. The Cat appears to him with a band of Hunches, encouraging him to use his Thinks to find his way home (""Havin' a Hunch""). Jojo does so and happily reunites with his parents, who forgive him for his Thinks.Gertrude sneaks into the circus to free Horton, explaining she plucked out all but one of her tail feathers to fly there, and confesses her love for him. She also reveals she has found his clover, delighting and relieving Horton to find the Whos alive and well (""All For You""). However, the Sour Kangaroo and the Wickersham brothers arrive to take Horton back to the jungle.In the jungle, Horton is put on trial for the crimes of ""talking to a speck, disturbing the peace, and loitering... on an egg""  (""The People Versus Horton the Elephant""). Aided by Gertrude, Horton makes his best case, but Judge Yertle the Turtle finds him guilty. He orders Horton remanded to the ""Nool Asylum for the Criminally Insane"" and the clover destroyed in a kettle of hot ""Beezle-Nut"" oil. Desperate, Horton encourages the Whos to make as much noise as possible to prove their existence, but the animals do not hear them. Jojo finally uses his Thinks to conjure a new word, ""Yopp"", which he shouts loudly enough to reach the animals' ears. Convinced at last, the animals repent and promise to help protect the Whos, and Horton is acquitted. Jojo is accepted by his parents and the rest of Who-ville as ""Thinker Non-Stop"" for saving their planet. Horton's egg hatches into a tiny flying ""Elephant-Bird"", amazing everyone, but dismaying Horton, who panics at the thought of flying progeny. Gertrude reassures him that they can raise the child together, and they agree to do so.With the story finished, the Cat returns to close the show (""Finale""/""Oh, the Thinks You Can Think!""), then vanishes along with the scenery, leaving his hat and Jojo, who is now the Boy again. The Boy picks the hat up, dons it, and says, ""Seuss!""During a curtain call, the company performs a number based on Green Eggs and Ham (""Green Eggs and Ham"").","So colorful & enchanting story begins with an empty stage, which has a red-and-white hat. Next, there is a little boy, who raises this hat. Under it, he finds the one he had long wanted to see – the Cat in the Hat! The legendary character creates around itself a fairy-tale world in which he also plays a role of narrator & supporting character. In addition, he becomes a mentor for a young traveler & together they are transferred to the Nool Jungle. The 1st on their way is found bathing Horton (the Elephant).  Curious animal lives a carefree life filled with joy & gladness. But once comes the unthinkable – he discerns talking from a tiny dust piece. The intrigued character finds out that inside of this very dust is located the tiniest planet in the entire Cosmos. It is inhabited by a variety of beings, named Whos. Our main character wants to tell his discovery to other creatures of his land. Much to his dismay, they not only did not believe his story, but also had a good laugh over him. Anyone else would have left this venture, but not our elephant. To confirm the existence of Whos, he leaves the jungle & goes to McEligott's Pool. On the way, Horton meets many well-known fairy-tale characters, among which is Lazy Mayzie. Together, they are capable of great achievements, including the salvation of the whole world, imprisoned in a tiny speck of dust."

"Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812","  Act 1 The story is set in Moscow, 1812, just before Napoleon's invasion of Russia and the burning of the city. The story begins by introducing the characters (""Prologue""), and then sets up the character Pierre, an old, sad, wealthy aristocrat, who is having an existential crisis, living a slothful life of wine, philosophy, and inaction (""Pierre""). He is best friends with Prince Andrey Bolkonsky (also sometimes spelt as Andrei), who has left to go to war. Andrey has recently become engaged to the young, beautiful countess Natasha Rostova. Natasha and her cousin Sonya arrive in Moscow to stay the winter with Natasha's godmother, Marya D., while Natasha waits for Andrey to return from the war. Marya D. is an old friend of Pierre's (""Moscow""). Marya D. advises Natasha that she must visit her future in-laws, the demented old Prince Bolkonsky and his pitiable spinster daughter Mary (""The Private and Intimate Life of the House""), to win their affection in advance of the marriage, which is critical to the status and fortune of the Rostov family. However, Natasha's visit with Mary and Bolkonsky ends in disaster (""Natasha & Bolkonskys""), as Mary finds Natasha vain, Natasha finds Mary cold, and Bolkonsky behaves bizarrely. Natasha leaves their home missing Andrey more than ever (""No One Else"").The next night Natasha is introduced to decadent Moscow society and watches an amazing performance with Marya and Sonya (""The Opera""). There she meets Prince Anatole Kuragin, a young and handsome man, who turns out to be a notorious rogue. He comes to visit Natasha's box and leaves her with feelings she has never experienced before (""Natasha & Anatole"").Anatole comes home after the opera and he, his friend Dolokhov, and Pierre go out drinking; they are met by Pierre's unpleasant wife, Hélène (Anatole's sister), who taunts Pierre and flirts with Dolokhov. Anatole plots with Dolokhov and Hélène to have the young woman he just met, although he is already married. Dolokhov taunts Pierre, toasting to the wives of society and their lovers. Pierre finds his wife's familiarity with Dolokhov offensive and drunkenly challenges him to a duel, accidentally wounding Dolokhov. When it is Dolokhov's turn to shoot, Pierre stands openly in front of the bullet, but Dolokhov miraculously misses him (""The Duel""). Before they all leave, Anatole asks Hélène to convince Natasha to come to the costume ball that she is hosting that evening. She agrees and they leave Pierre. Alone, Pierre reflects on his near-death experience and realizes that despite wasting his life, he wishes to live (""Dust and Ashes"").Natasha and her family go to church the next morning. She is confused about her interaction with Anatole the night before, and questions if she is spoiled of Andrey's love (""Sunday Morning""). Hélène does as her brother asks and visits Natasha. She invites her to the ball that she is hosting that night,and eventually Natasha agrees to come (""Charming""). That night, Natasha meets Anatole, and they dance. Anatole tells Natasha that he loves her, but she protests, reminding Anatole that she is betrothed to Andrey. Ignoring this, Anatole kisses her, leading her to fall in love with him in return (""The Ball""). Act 2 Anatole and Natasha make plans to elope—she still does not know that he is married—and Natasha tearfully breaks off her engagement with Andrey, while Pierre writes to him of his belief that Napoleon is the biblical Beast of Revelation, and that he is destined to be Napoleon's assassin (""Letters""). Sonya finds out about the plan and realizes it will mean Natasha's ruin (""Sonya & Natasha""); Sonya determines to save Natasha from herself even if it means she will lose her closest friend (""Sonya Alone""). That evening Anatole and Dolokhov plan for the elopement (""Preparations""), and Dolokhov tries to change Anatole's mind with no success. Balaga, their trusted troika driver (""Balaga""), soon arrives to take them to Natasha's house and a wild party ensues as Anatole bids farewell to his friends. However, they are thwarted at the last moment by Marya D. (""The Abduction""). Marya D. scolds Natasha but then tries to comfort her with Sonya's help. Natasha screams at them, breaks down and waits for Anatole to come back for her all night (""In My House"").Marya D. calls on Pierre in the middle of the night (""A Call to Pierre""), begging him to handle the crisis, and Pierre finally learns that the object of Anatole's conquest is Natasha. Marya D. finds out that Anatole is married and tells a grief-stricken Natasha. Pierre, outraged, searches for Anatole (""Find Anatole""). When Pierre finds Anatole, he comes close to attacking him in rage, but instead gives him money and orders him to leave Moscow (”Pierre & Anatole”). Natasha poisons herself with arsenic (""Natasha Very Ill"") but lives. The next day Andrey returns. Pierre explains the scandal to him and asks him to be compassionate, but Andrey is unable to forgive Natasha and will not ask for her hand in marriage again (""Pierre & Andrey""). Finally, Pierre visits Natasha (""Pierre & Natasha"") and he comforts the distraught girl, giving her hope. After their meeting, Pierre experiences a moment of enlightenment himself while seeing The Great Comet of 1812 in the night sky (“The Great Comet of 1812”).","1812. Moscow. Shortly before the invasion of Napoleon's army. Pierre is a rich aristocrat, who is in a deep spiritual crisis. His life is filled with wine, philosophy and sloth. At the same time, young Natasha Rostova and her cousin came to the capital to Marya – they were going to stay at hers all winter. She was the godmother of Natalia. She was expecting her groom Andrey to return from the war. Marya recommended to own goddaughter to visit her fiancé’s father and sister. Good relations with these nobles could in the future help her family to improve financial position. A visit to the old Count Bolkonsky and his daughter was unsuccessful – the girl was unable to win their love. Natasha even more began to miss her fiancé.  The next night, the girl entered a secular Moscow society – she attended the opera. There she met Anatole, the young officer who was well-known ladies' man and a deceiver. After his courtship, Natasha began to experience confused and mixed feelings. Now, her love for Andrey seemed not as strong as she thought of it. Anatole and his friends left the room. Soon they met a sister of Anatole. She quarreled with her husband because of his behavior with other friend. Anatole said that he would achieve Natasha’s love. The officer did not stop even in the presence of his own wife. Pierre called Dolokhov on a duel that from his side was a suicide. Then the man began to reflect about his life.  Sunday morning Rostova with family and friends attended church. Soon they came to Helene. The woman invited Natasha to the ball – this is where Anatole was going to seduce her. The venture of a womanizer did not fail – the officer was able to win the heart of an inexperienced girl. Soon they planned a joint elopement. Natasha broke off her engagement to Andrey, writing him a letter. When Sonya learned about all what was happening, she realized that this action would destroy her cousin. She decided to stop a girl by all means. The same evening Anatole and Dolokhov arrived to the house where Natalia lived. But the planned runaway failed – instead of a girl Marya came out on the porch and drove them away.  Having dealt with failed kidnappers, a woman scolded her goddaughter. Then she sent a message to Pierre, asking him for help – immediate expelling of Anatole from the capital required. Natalia could not survive such exposure and tried to poison herself. Soon Bolkonsky returned. Pierre told him about the scandal that happened with his ex-fiancée, and asked him to be merciful to the girl. But the angry Count would not listen to the opinion of his friend. Soon, Pierre visited sick Natalia. After their meeting, the man survived the moment of enlightenment, when he saw a great comet in the sky of 1812."
Twisted," Twisted is presented as an alternate history of the events of Aladdin: instead of being a scheming villain, Ja'far is a good-intentioned, hard-working official who wants what's best for the kingdom, but is nevertheless blamed for all the problems of society. The Princess is portrayed not as a heroine, but as an arrogant spoiled child who doesn't realize the potential consequences of humiliating a powerful foreign prince. Aladdin is lazy and immature, thieving because he does not want to work, and not caring about the victims of his crimes. Instead of taking place in Agrabah, the events unfold in ""the Magic Kingdom"", a euphemism for The Walt Disney Company and its financial struggles in the 1990s. The foreign kingdom of Pik-zahr is based on Pixar, the pioneer of 3-D animation.  The story has allegorical references to the rivalry between the companies, which ended in 2006 when Disney bought out Pixar.  Act I The play opens with Scheherazade introducing the Magic Kingdom, which once prospered because of ""the 2-Ds"": duty and devotion (a reference to Disney's traditional 2-D animation). Ja'far, the Royal Vizier, walks through the kingdom while conversing with the villagers (""Dream a Little Harder""). He is constantly harassed by the villagers, who blame him for all of their problems despite his attempts to solve the kingdom's socioeconomic inequality. The Captain of the Guard arrives and informs Ja'far of a thief terrorizing the populace. Several of his own guards were killed in pursuit of him when he stole a loaf of bread. However, Ja'far has to focus on keeping the peace with Pik-zahr; their prince, Achmed, is visiting and Ja'far hopes to extend the trade contract between their two kingdoms. The Captain reveals that the same thief who stole the loaf of bread, Aladdin, humiliated the Prince earlier that day in town. Worried, Ja'far rushes back to the palace in order to check on the Prince's breakfast with the Princess. Aladdin then appears, gloating that he lives by taking whatever he wants, regardless of the consequences or other people's needs (""I Steal Everything"").Ja'far returns to the palace but is greeted by an angry Prince Achmed, upon whom the Princess has set her pet tiger. Insulted, Prince Achmed declares war on the Magic Kingdom. Although Ja'far berates the Princess for her actions and carelessness, the Princess only longs for freedom (""Everything and More"").To come up with a way to avoid war, Ja'far gathers his assistant viziers but discovers the department has been disbanded and its members killed. Disappointed and furious at the Sultan's choice to execute such talented people, Ja'far takes out his anger on the decorations in the room. Amidst the chaos, Ja'far finds a golden necklace (""Sands of Time""). In a flashback, years ago Ja'far is loved by the village and teaches them lessons on how to be kind to one another by treating others as they wish to be treated (""The Golden Rule""). On his first day on the job as the new Assistant Royal Vizier, Ja'far discovers that the Royal Vizier and his court are corrupt and only care about money (""The Golden Rule (Evil Reprise)"").Though disheartened by the amount of corruption in the palace, Ja'far's mood is lifted when he meets Scheherazade, a storyteller and palace entertainer who has just had her ear cut off by one of her masters. As Jafar stitches the wound, Scheherazade tells Ja'far of the story of the Tiger Head Cave and shows him her half of a golden scarab necklace which, when combined with the other half, will reveal the location of the hidden Tiger Head Cave. Though Ja'far is a man of facts and science, he is charmed by Scheherazade's wisdom and beauty. As Ja'far and Scheherazade get to know each other, they fall in love and marry (""A Thousand and One Nights""). A few years later, Ja'far continues to struggle against the corruption and incompetence of the palace, but one day Scheherazade announces that she is pregnant. Ja'far is overjoyed, especially since the couple has been trying for some time to conceive. Suddenly, a guard informs Ja'far that his request to meet with the Sultan has been granted and he is to report to the palace immediately.When Ja'far takes Scheherazade with him to his meeting with the Sultan, the Sultan is attracted to Scheherazade and claims her as his wife. Ja'far protests and is beaten down by the guards. Scheherazade reminds Ja'far that he will be a great Vizier someday, and to never stop believing. She gives him her scarab necklace and vows that they will be reunited one day, before she is taken away to the Sultan's harem. Back in the present, Ja'far mourns over losing Scheherazade, first to the Sultan and later ""to heaven"". Despondent, Ja'far decides to seek out the wish-granting Djinn that dwells within the Tiger Head Cave, and change his fate and the fate of the kingdom (""If I Believed"").The Captain suddenly arrives and informs Ja'far that the Princess has run away. The Princess meets Aladdin and is entranced by his lack of concern for royal power and his freedom, although she is oblivious to his sexual advances. He then talks about his past, and how he recently became an orphan (""Orphaned At Thirty-Three""). Before they can kiss, they are caught by the royal guards, who throw Aladdin in prison and take the Princess home.Meanwhile, Ja'far retrieves the other half of the golden scarab from a corrupt merchant. He bails Aladdin out of jail to go to the Tiger Head Cave and retrieve the Djinn's lamp, during which Aladdin reveals his true intentions: he doesn't love the Princess nor had any reason to rule the kingdom, he just wants to sleep with her. The Princess, Aladdin, and Ja'far all reflect on what they want most: a happy ending (""Happy Ending""). As Aladdin exits the Tiger Head Cave, he decides to take the Djinn's lamp for himself. Act II Prince Achmed returns to his kingdom to commiserate over his humiliation at the hands of the Princess. He is further embarrassed when his guards see the scars on his butt from the tiger attack and assume he had sex with a tiger, earning him the nickname ""tiger fucker"". Achmed prepares his army and despairs that he will only be remembered as a ""throwaway joke"" despite his soldiers insisting that they care about him and that he is special (""No One Remembers Achmed""). He appears to have feelings for the Princess, but mistakenly believes that destroying her kingdom will make her love him.Back in the Magic Kingdom, Ja'far and the Princess have a heart-to-heart, during which Ja'far warns her about Aladdin and how people like him are only interested in one thing. Ja'far tries to teach the Princess responsibility, but she insists she could run the kingdom already. When asked how she would fix the socioeconomic inequality, she declares that everyone should be a princess, so that everyone would be happy and treated with respect. Ja'far dismisses this idea, saying she will learn how it is simply a dream. He then continues to warn her about Aladdin and all princes, warning that if they begin serenading her, ""a song is a dick in sheep's clothing"". The Captain interrupts and tells them that a parade is unexpectedly taking place in the market, led by a mysterious visiting prince; Ja'far speculates that it could be Aladdin. As they leave, Aladdin visits the Princess, who sees through his disguise immediately and happily embraces him. He momentarily breaks the fourth wall to tell the audience how he plans to get the Princess into bed with him -- by planting not-so-subtle subliminal messages in their conversation. Now suspicious, The Princess also breaks the fourth wall to ask the audience if Ja'far was right about Aladdin, only for an unhelpful audience member to assure her otherwise. Aladdin takes the Princess on a magic carpet ride where he tries to convince her to (""Take Off Your Clothes""), but is unsuccessful. The Princess, thinking that Aladdin's wealth and power could be what the kingdom needs to defeat Prince Achmed, asks him to marry her; he reluctantly agrees.Ja'far consults with the Sultan, who confirms that Aladdin will marry the Princess and he will bring his armies to defend them from Prince Achmed's forces. Ja'far tries to expose Aladdin, but Aladdin tricks everyone into thinking Ja'far is a sorcerer. Ja'far escapes and manages to take the lamp. Ja'far feels guilty for betraying his Sultan, but knows that he simply cannot stand by as the people of his kingdom suffer. His soliloquy is interrupted by the appearance of several villains from Scheherazade's tales, who claim that their stories have been twisted to the point where they are portrayed as villains. (Except for Cruella de Vil who is shunned even by them.) (""Twisted""). Ja'far then accepts that he has to take the ""twisted"" path, and decides to do the right thing for the kingdom even if it means being remembered as a villain.When Prince Achmed's forces arrive the Princess calls for Aladdin's ""army"" to defend them, but Aladdin is nowhere to be seen. Ja'far then appears and uses his first wish on the lamp to make himself Sultan; he uses the second to make himself a powerful sorcerer. With his newfound powers, Ja'far is able to repel the majority of Achmed's army. During the battle, Aladdin tries to get the Princess to have sex with him, but she refuses. When Ja'far arrives, Aladdin takes the Princess hostage and reveals a darker, more sinister personality. This alternate persona killed Aladdin's parents when they wanted him to move out and get a job. Ja'far begs Aladdin to spare the Princess and realizes that the Princess is actually his daughter –- the Sultan is impotent and Scheherazade was pregnant when she was taken to the harem. Aladdin agrees to release the Princess in exchange for the lamp, but before Ja'far hands it over, he uses his final wish to free the Djinn and take its place in the lamp. The Djinn rejoices and disappears; Ja'far is now a Djinn.Aladdin flees in terror as Ja'far revels in his new abilities. Ja'far reaffirms his loyalty to the Princess and hands her the lamp, believing her youth and passion make her the only one who can truly use the lamp's power to its fullest potential. The Princess is unsure if she can rule the kingdom and doesn't know what to do without Ja'far's guidance, but he assures her that she has the power to lead without him (""The Power In Me""). The Princess wishes to bring a peaceful end to the war with Pik-zahr, and for the kingdom to have a Sultan that will make it the happiest place on Earth once again. Finally, she wishes that Ja'far will not have to go, but he sadly tells her that there are some wishes he cannot grant. Instead, she wishes for Ja'far's every happiness; he and the lamp return to the Tiger Head Cave. Two of the Princess' servants then arrive with the Sultan's final declaration before his death: naming the Princess the new ruler of the Magic Kingdom. The Captain then reveals that Ali Baba's lost treasure was discovered during the battle. Achmed's troops arrive in the throne room, and the Princess offers to buy the entirety of Pik-zahr with Ali Baba's treasure. She adds a condition that Pik-zahr send their best artisans and craftsmen to bring back ""the 2-Ds""; Achmed agrees. For her next act as Sultan, the Princess declares that everyone is a princess, and the kingdom celebrates.Ja'far, now trapped within the lamp forever, resigns himself to his fate when he is suddenly greeted by Scheherazade. Reincarnated as a result of the Princess' last wish, Scheherazade tells Ja'far that she can stay in the lamp with him forever. Because the inside of the lamp exists outside time and space (explaining how the Djinn was able to watch and quote movies centuries before they were made), Scheherazade can also look into the future. She reveals that the Princess brought about the third golden age of the Magic Kingdom and followed the Golden Rule by making everyone a princess. Additionally, Ja'far learns that Aladdin has an ignominious future where he becomes old and fat, making a living by selling second-hand goods and telling a twisted version of the previously seen story, until he is killed by a thief for a loaf of bread at age 55. Ja'far asks how their story ends, to which Scheherazade replies that it doesn't, and they kiss (""Finale / A Thousand And One Nights Reprise"").", 
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,"  Act 1 Inside a lively casino near the French Riviera (""Overture""), con-artist Lawrence Jameson is tricking wealthy women out of their money with the help of his ""bodyguard"" Andre (""Give Them What They Want""). Muriel Eubanks and a few other women express their devotion and amorous feelings for Lawrence, who has conned them (""What Was a Woman To Do""). Andre warns Lawrence about a highly successful con-artist known as ""The Jackal"", who is said to be visiting the area. Later, aboard a train, Lawrence watches an American named Freddy Benson (who he figures is The Jackal) swindle a woman, but notes that Freddy makes much less money than Lawrence does. Lawrence brings Freddy to his lavish mansion, where Freddy envies Lawrence's success as a swindler and describes everything he'll have when he's rich (""Great Big Stuff""). Freddy asks Lawrence to show him his ways. Andre thinks Freddy is unworthy of Lawrence's attention and compares Freddy to a chimp in a suit (""Chimp in a Suit""). Lawrence considers Freddy's request until Jolene Oakes, a woman he's conned, informs him at gunpoint that he's going to marry her and move with her to Oklahoma (""Oklahoma?""). Then Lawrence decides to use Freddy's help. Freddy poses as Lawrence's repulsive brother Ruprecht (""All About Ruprecht""). Seeing that Lawrence plans to make Ruprecht a large part of their life together, Jolene calls off the wedding.Lawrence begins to think that there isn't enough room in town for both him and Freddy after the pair argue. They make a deal: the first to swindle a woman out of $50,000 gets to stay in town, while the other has to leave. Immediately after they agree on this, the arrival of ""The American Soap Queen"" is announced. Her name is Christine Colgate, and she is optimistic, naive and hopelessly clumsy, constantly bumping into people (""Here I Am""). Both con men decide to target her. Freddy presents himself as a man paralyzed from the waist down. Christine and Freddy discuss his medical options and he explains that only one therapist, Dr. Shuffhausen, can help him, but he can't afford Dr. Shuffhausen's $50,000 fee. Christine tells him to keep his hopes up (""Nothing Is Too Wonderful To Be True"") and offers to pay for the therapy just as Freddy had hoped (""The Miracle""). Then she reveals that Dr. Shuffhausen is at the hotel and Freddy is shocked to discover that Lawrence is Shuffhausen. Act 2 After a quick introduction (""Entr'acte""), Lawrence as Shuffhausen performs several torturous tests on Freddy (""Ruffhousin' Mit Shuffhausen""), who has to endure them without complaint. In the side show Muriel meets Andre and the two fall in love (""Like Zis/Like Zat""). Lawrence makes every effort to get close to Christine (""The More We Dance""). When he realizes that Christine is not as rich as they thought. Lawrence tells Freddy that they should call off their $50,000 contest. Freddy reluctantly agrees and they agree on new terms: whoever beds Christine gets to stay. Freddy sleeps with her, then hires two sailors to kidnap Lawrence so that he can have Christine to himself.Freddy meets with Christine at the hotel where he tells her he needs motivation to get out of his chair. She says she'll be his motivation (""Love is My Legs"").

The subject of his lamentation was Fran, working as a waitress in the cafeteria of insurance company, where Chuck worked.  After some time, the boss of the insurance company paid attention to the rave reviews of the work of Chuck. Managers thus were fulfilling their part of the agreement. But instead of to advance Chuck's career, boss begins to find out the lowdown and learns about the apartment.

Pam and Nick are also at the birth, and they seem jealous, but hopeful (""The Birth/Finale"").","The story tells of three different hetero pairs of people of different ages and social status, each of which is expecting for the child. Some – the first, and someone – already far not the first. And everyone goes through crises that are linked to this issue. Senior couple who already had children (as many as three) who have left the nest, considering new child through the prism of fear and reluctance no less than the young ones, to whom such an experience is for the first time. The first are afraid that they have long since have been a ""couple"" and ""parents"" is absolutely different thing and they are held together simply because of being the parents, and not once loving people. And the most memorable moments they relate to children, rather to anything they did together.  The other pair – Pam & Nick – athletic and fit, but good physical condition does not help them and they are faced with problems at the beginning of the process of procreation – conceiving.

Ballroom," Bea Asher has been widowed for a year, but while her family has virtually enshrined her late husband, Bea won't accept ""widow"" as her designation for the rest of her life. She has opened a thrift shop that amounts to an ongoing garage sale of her own belongings. When her friend Angie urges her to get out of the shop and start living again and suggests that she visit a local dance hall, the Stardust Ballroom, Bea agrees. Outside the hall that night, Bea summons her courage and goes in. The Stardust represents the American ballroom-dancing tradition that thrived in an earlier era; time seems to have flattened out. There are no young people here to carry on the tradition — but the Stardust regulars will keep the flame burning.On the Stardust floor, a foxtrot is in progress featuring the house band and singers. One spectacular dance succeeds another as Bea is drawn into the excitement. She meets Al Rossi, a mailman (""I'm in the government""). Like the other regulars, Al shakes off the tedium and the fear of daily life by dancing, and he spins Bea through cha-cha, merengue, waltz and, finally, a foxtrot. Bea hasn't felt this way in years. Al asks to drive her home, but Bea demurs; she goes home happy, however, and proud.Helen, sister of Bea's late husband, waits for her to return home, thinking something terrible has happened. When she discovers that Bea has been out enjoying herself, she becomes outraged at the insult to her brother's memory. A moment after Helen furiously departs, Al phones Bea to say what a fine time he had and how much he hopes to see her again. Bea asks Al to phone again — but at the shop, not at home.A month later, the ballroom regulars are in the middle of the Tango. Tonight, Bea lets Al take her home and invites him in for coffee. Haltingly, Al tries to tell her how he feels about her, and Bea has what she feared she would never have again, the feeling of being loved. But the next day, her family again intrudes. At the junk shop, Bea realises her plans to go back to the Stardust that evening conflict with an earlier promise to baby-sit for her daughter, Diane. Bea tries to get her sister-in-law to help, with no luck, then offers to pay for a sitter. When Diane tries to insist, Bea makes it clear that she has begun a new chapter in her life and that the ballroom will take priority.That night, Al again waits for Bea at the Stardust. When she appears, she is no longer gray-haired and simply dressed, but has dyed her hair red and wears a beautiful gown. The transformation is Bea's brightest moment, and Al takes her around the floor in celebration. Al and Bea return to her home, obviously very much in love, and it appears Bea's fairy tale has reached its happy conclusion, but Al can no longer keep back the truth: he is married, and while he and his wife do not love each other, he will never end the union. This is all of Al that Bea will ever have, and the scene ends as she tries to come to terms with that.The next week at the Stardust, the regulars learn the ""new"" dance craze, the hustle; tonight, also, the dancers will nominate candidates for a new Queen of the Stardust Ballroom. Angie nominates Bea, but Bea is distracted because Al isn't there. Finally, as everyone departs, Al arrives, all apologies, but even though Bea thinks she has accepted that this is how things must be, she feels afraid and vulnerable. She runs off, with Al watching her go. She returns home to find her family waiting for her: her sister-in-law has summoned Bea's son, David, from California to help them talk Bea out of her new way of life. Everyone except David attacks her, but Bea remains unshaken in her resolve: ""Have you ever been in this house alone? Have you ever been everywhere alone?"" Finally, Bea throws them all out. Left alone again, Bea confronts her situation and accepts her relationship with Al for what it is. The ballroom holds the biggest night of the year. All the regulars wear tuxedos and gowns. When a drum roll signals the moment for naming the new Queen, Bea is chosen and pours out her heart to her new friends. She will probably never have Al to herself, but she has found a life. Al leads Bea through one more dance, joined by the entire company, as the curtain falls.",

He had a wife, whom he seems to loved, but not listened to her pleases and requests to find some decent job, which would give stable earnings. Not that he did not like to work, but have been always engaged in some garbage affairs. He tried himself as a seller of juke boxes (somehow, completely penniless, he and his accomplices with comical names Fatso, Brains & Skin, were able to buy as much as 300 ones & tried to resell them to some music producer. Just what the hell did he needed them for, these music boxes, if he was producing real artists, not some cranky machines?). Then he was trying to become a producer of some naive canary who sincerely believed that this person may bring her to the people – despite that he was not able to bring himself there. And he did that in spite of the fact having a wife, tolerant and moderately careful as much as it is possible to take care of this scoundrel, unable to be called a man, not having normal income to provide him and his family. As in that joke, when a woman says to her son at the zoo that a man is the one who has money, otherwise it is considered to be a mate (like those male gorillas in the cells).  His wife, a cute emotional woman Kay, reflects of how unhappy she is in marriage. The reasons why she remains with him and suffer all his failures and lack of permanent income – are unclear. Maybe she loves him? Too unobvious. In the end, he realizes that the only thing he has got is a nice marriage.

Passing Strange," summary  Act I The Narrator introduces himself as Stew (""Prologue""), openly referring to himself, Heidi, and the rest of the band, and occasionally interrupting the plot and interacting directly with the characters throughout the play. The Narrator introduces the African-American male protagonist as ""the Youth""—whom the Narrator also refers to as the ""hero"" or ""pilgrim"". In a late 1970s South Central Los Angeles middle-class neighborhood, the Youth begins searching for ""the real"" during his teenaged years, having just briefly turned to Zen Buddhism in defiance of his single mother's conservative Christian faith (""Baptist Fashion Show""). Regardless, he is reluctantly dragged to her church and feels surprisingly moved by the church's gospel band, joyfully equating gospel to rock & roll (""Blues Revelation / Freight Train"") and, deciding to explore the spiritual power of music, he joins the church choir (""Edwina Williams""). Here, he meets the pastor's son and choir director, Franklin Jones, who as a marijuana-smoking closeted gay man, exposes the Youth to drugs, New Negro culture, and European philosophy (""Arlington Hill""). The Youth eventually begins playing guitar, deserts Franklin's choir, and forms a punk rock band (""Sole Brother""), which quickly dissolves during a bad LSD trip (""Must've Been High"").The Youth saves money to travel to Europe where he hopes to truly develop as a musical artist, despite his mother and community's disapproval (""Mom Song / Philistines""), culminating in an argument that satirizes the overly dramatic styles of European experimental cinema and which soon merges onstage into the actual journey to Europe (""Merci Beaucoup, M. Godard""). Now in promiscuous Amsterdam, with its easy access to drugs and sex (""Amsterdam""), the Youth experiences his first sense of acceptance when a local squatter, Marianna, unquestioningly accepts him into her apartment (""Keys""). After happily living among Marianna and other free-spirited artists (""We Just Had Sex""), he finds he cannot write songs when he has nothing to complain about. He heads to Berlin, leaving behind an upset Marianna, who tells him not to return (""Paradise""). Act 2 The Youth arrives in West Berlin during a May Day riot (""May Day""), joining some of the performance-artist protesters (""Surface""). His integrity falters when he misrepresents himself as poor to be accepted by the revolutionary artists whom he now lives with, collectively called Nowhaus. Desi, his new girlfriend and the Nowhaus leader, tells him that only love is real (""Damage"").The Youth can never bring himself to be honest about his background (""Identity""), though he basks in a romanticized African-American stereotype amidst his German friends (""The Black One""). Desi finally expresses her feelings that the Youth is concealing his true identity (""Come Down Now""). Meanwhile, he is irritated by his heartsick mother's phone calls and delays visiting her, even with Christmas approaching, when the other Nowhaus members abruptly return home to their families. The Youth pleads with Desi to stay with him during the holidays, but they fight over their differing views on love and she leaves him (""Youth's Unfinished Song"").The Narrator's self-reflections promptly enter into the Youth's story (""Work the Wound""), concluding with the unexpected scene of the Youth at his mother's funeral. With this surprisingly dramatic turns of events, the tone of the play shifts from largely comedic to suddenly heavy-hearted. The Narrator and the Youth confront each other directly and in a serious moment for the first time as the Youth copes with his grief; dealing with the loss of the same mother, it is clear now that the Narrator and Youth represent the same person at two different times in his life (""Passing Phase""). The Youth, after declaring that only art can correct the mistake known as life, resurrects his mother's spirit through his art (""Is It Alright?""). Ultimately, however, only the more mature Narrator remains onstage, professing the need for something beyond ""the real"" and that this is love (""Love Like That"").","Storyteller told viewers about a life story of the search, which was carried out by Afro-American adolescent in the late 1970s named Youth. He was the representative of the mid-class of America. He lived in LA’s South Central. Being a teenager, he began searches for true reality. The young man turned for some time to such religion as Zen Buddhism, which did not like his mother who brought up her son alone, as she was prudent Christian. Despite the attempts in finding a new faith, Youth had to visit the Evangelical house of Christ. The boy has been touched by singing of the local band. He began to compare the gospel to rock'n'roll.  Our pal has decided to understand the ecclesiastical strength of this chimes & joined the tabernacle chorus. There the young man became acquainted with fellow named Franklin who was an offspring of a rector and a lead person of the tabernacle chorus. But also a guy was a homosexual & smoked marijuana. Franklin introduced our pal to prohibited substances, his low & new age outlooks. After some time, young man began to play the guitar. The young man left the tabernacle chorus & created his own punk rock gang. But it soon fell apart due to abuse of prohibited substances.  Youth began to save money to travel to European countries – the young man had hoped to develop in the Old World as a musical artist. He wasn’t stopped neither by the disapproval of the mother nor by the people around. Soon he went on a journey. Arriving in Amsterdam – the city, where drugs & sex were widely available – the young man became acquainted with Marianna. She invited guy to live together. Settling at hers, Youth started seeing other free craftsmen. Gradually, the young man realized – if he cannot complain at least on something, he won’t be able to create songs. So he has decided to go to the capital of Germany & left his girlfriend. She said that she no longer wants to see him.  He joined the youth during the May uprising in Berlin. To be accepted into the community of the poor artists, the young man had to lie about his well-being (he said that he was poor). This way the young man joined the Nowhaus. Their leader was girl named Desi. Soon she became a new acquaintance of our pal. She explained that in our existence the only valuable thing is love. The new friends treated our pal and his creativeness very well. Because of this, for the young man it was more & more difficult to admit in his fraud. Desi felt Youth was hiding from others own real face. The boy was irked because of calls from his parent. He wasn’t in a hurry to visit her, despite the fact that Christmas was coming. All participants of Nowhaus went on holiday to their beloved ones & families. Because of the different views on love, Dasi had a fight with our pal & she went away from the musician.  Time passed & now the young man was at the funeral of his mother. It turned out that the narrator was more adult version of Youth. He had already gone through moments of his youth, but still remembered them. By that time, the young man realized that through art, he is able to resurrect the spirit of his mother – his work will help him do it. At the end, only the narrator remained on the scene. He explained that only love is beyond reality. That's what Youth was trying to understand, making his long journey."
New girl in town," Anna, a former streetwalker recovering from tuberculosis, returns home to live with her aging father, ex-sailor Chris Christopherson, in turn-of-the-20th century New York City after plying her trade in St. Paul, Minnesota for 15 years. Unaware of her sordid past, and remembering Anna as an innocent young girl, Chris joyfully welcomes his daughter home (""Anna Lilla""). Anna initially is welcomed by Chris's friends and seems to be finding happiness. She becomes romantically involved with a sailor, Mat Burke, but hides the relationship from her father. Chris is furious when Marthy, his jealous common-law wife, drunkenly reveals the truth about Anna's past. Anna's sailor leaves on the next ship, and her hopes of leading a normal life seem dashed, but Anna picks up the pieces of her life, becoming a farmer in Staten Island. When Mat finally returns to port, Chris tries to keep the two lovers apart, but their reunification is inevitable – time heals all wounds, and the lovers kiss and make up.","New York. The beginning of XX century. The captain of the barge Chris Christopherson was teasing prostitutes, awaiting sailors in the day of payment. Girlfriend Marthy told him the news – his daughter is about to arrive. Man sent Anna at the age of 5 years to live with cousins in Minnesota. After that, he never saw her. A girl wrote that she works as a nurse. Marthy started to search for a daughter of Chris. Soon she saw a young woman who came into the bar and ordered a whiskey. Having learned that the battered person is 20-year-old Anna, Marthy was really surprised. Captain's daughter confessed – she was engaged in prostitution before and went to prison. After finding her illness, the girl was released. Anna became so because of the cousins, who, as erroneously thought Chris, she was safe to live with.  Soon the girl's father came. Chris offered his daughter to swim with him on a barge to recover her strengths. He also asked Marthy to live separately, to make way for Anna. The woman was angry and hit the captain. On father's barge, Anna felt better. Soon the crew saved the shipwrecked people. Seeing the girl, a sailor Mat tried to kiss her. Anna slipped away from the sailor. After returning to the harbor, Mat has attracted the attention of journalists – he talked about his own salvation, constantly mentioning this girl.  Chris bought his daughter two tickets to the ball in Tammany Hall. The girl was chased by Masher, who claimed that he had known her before. Mat drove man away. Marthy resented on Chris – captain distanced himself from her, believing that his daughter should not communicate with such a woman. Concubine had stolen from him one ticket to the ball. Mat asked Anna, what feelings she feels for him. A girl admitted that fell in love with him. Soon Chris came. The captain fell into a rage when he heard from Mat that he wants to marry his daughter. Anna surprised them both. She stated that she could not marry her beloved. Resolving of this issue was postponed for another time – the ball started soon.  Marthy appeared at the ceremony wearing an updated dress and the old captain's shoes. Soon she began to drink. Mat was jealous of Anna, which enjoyed great success in men’s circle. When a sailor tried to bring a drunken Marthy out, she hinted about the past of his beloved. Mat asked about this directly from Anna, and she admitted that she was a prostitute. The man backed away from his beloved. He decided to sail away on any ship as quickly as possible. Realizing own actions, distressed Marthy advised a girl not to admit her past. Anna tried to explain to her beloved that she had changed, but he did not believe her. Upset girl left the ball. Gathering own stuff in the room of her father, the daughter told him about her past. Soon Chris floated away on a barge. When the girl came with a bag on the street, gardener Henry has spoken to her respectfully – he considered her a respectable lady.  A year has passed. Anna lived and worked on a farm of Henry. Chris met Mat, who returned to the banks – he was going to sail away in a few hours. The captain had deceived him, saying that his daughter was married. Soon Anna and Henry came. The girl said to Mat, that she is not married, but simply works on the farm. They agreed to meet later. Chris saw the changed Marthy. She helped to fund of sailors rescue to collect money. Mat asked her, how would he understand, whether Anna continues to love him. The woman told him to look at the girl's clothes. When Anna met with a man, she wore a beautiful dress, put on especially for the sailor. Enchanted Mat promised to come back as soon as circumstances permit to marry her."
Grind," Summary The PrologueThe singers, dancers, comedians, and strippers who make up the ensemble of Harry Earle's Burlesque take the stage and welcome the audience (“This Must Be the Place”). The year is 1933 and the city is Chicago. We are introduced to the white characters: HARRY EARLE, the owner of the venue; his wife, ROMAINE, who is a stripper; and the lead white comedians, SOLLY and GUS. We are also introduced to the black characters: LEROY, the lead black comedian; SATIN, who is also a stripper; and MAYBELLE, the wardrobe lady for the black performers.Act OneBackstage, the color lines are harshly drawn: The white performers congregate in one dressing room, while the black performers congregate in another. Black and white performers do not perform together onstage during the various acts, as dictated by the local authorities.Leroy, a known playboy who has had affairs with many of the black chorus girls, flirts with Satin and orders ribs for the women. Harry interviews LINETTE, who is applying to become one of the black chorus girls. In a private moment, Gus confesses to Solly that he's been losing his eyesight. Solly assures that Gus that as long as the routines go well, no one will notice.Onstage, Gus performs a hospital sketch with Satin (who plays a sexy nurse) and an actor referred to as The Stooge (“Cadaver”). The sketch goes awry when Gus accidentally sticks The Stooge with a prop needle, which causes the actor to quit the show. Gus tries to brush off the incident, but Harry is quick to point out that this is the third “Stooge” to quit in two weeks. Satin goes onstage to perform a strip routine (“A Sweet Thing Like Me”).Gus, unable to find a replacement sketch partner, enters the alley outside the venue so he can think (“I Get Myself Out”). In a moment of desperation, he enlists DOYLE, one of the many homeless men who reside in the alley. Doyle is drunk and doesn't speak, but Gus moves forward.Inside the venue, Harry speaks with DIX, a neighborhood cop. Dix is assured that none of the performers are violating color lines and is invited to take a look around to ensure this fact. Gus introduces Doyle to Harry, who rejects the bum outright. Nevertheless, Gus tells Doyle to wait for him in his dressing room. Doyle, confused and unfamiliar with the venue, walks upstairs to the black dressing room.Leroy arrives with ribs and continues to flirt with Satin, who has been unsettled by the appearance of Dix. Leroy assures her and the black chorus girls that everything will be fine (“My Daddy Always Taught Me to Share”). When he goes upstairs to the black dressing room, Leroy is surprised to find Doyle waiting. He leads the stranger downstairs to the white dressing room and offers him a bottle of whiskey, which Doyle eagerly accepts. Gus, Solly, and Romaine desperately try to sober Doyle up in time for his first performance.In the alley, Satin meets with her kid brother, GROVER. Satin has been giving Grover money she's earned to help their mother, MRS. OVETHA FAYE. Mrs. Faye, who appears in the alley, makes it clear that she does not want her daughter's money, as it has been earned working at the burlesque venue. Mrs. Faye exits with Grover, leaving Satin to fume. Leroy tries to comfort her, though she assumes it is yet another pass. She reveals her true name (Laticia) and insists that the woman Leroy sees onstage every night is not the woman he'd be bringing home. When she eventually settles down, it will be with the kind of man “they don’t make anymore” (“All Things To One Man”. Leroy, taken aback by her display of emotion, makes a joke before heading onstage. During his routine (“The Line”), Leroy despairs over his inability to be serious when the moment counts.Gus and Doyle, having managed to squeak through their first performance, exit into the alley. When Gus tries to worm his way out of paying Doyle, the latter lashes out. Gus begs Doyle to return the next day so that they may continue working together. Doyle, left alone, begins to sing to an unseen wife and son (“Katie, My Love”). He secretly longs to die so that he may be with them. Satin asks if he's okay, to which Doyle replies, “I could tell you I’m feelin’ no pain, ma’am - but I'd be lyin’.”The next morning, the performers slowly enter as Gus waits for Doyle’s arrival. The company sings (“Rise and Shine”), with the performers complaining and Maybelle encouraging them to do their best. We see Satin discussing a bike with Leroy over the phone. Gus is delighted to find a newly shaven, cleanly dressed Doyle waiting in the dressing room. Leroy enters with a new bike that he and Satin plan to give to Grover on his 10th birthday. When it's revealed that Leroy doesn't know how to ride a bike, Doyle offers to ride it to Grover's home (“Yes Ma’am”). Leroy and Satin mock Mrs. Faye as they head to the south side of Chicago (“Why Mama Why”).At Mrs. Faye's home, Satin and Leroy arrive just as Doyle coasts in on Grover's new bike. They present an upside down cake prepared by Romaine but Mrs. Faye, incensed, denounces the party so that she may focus on her ironing. Doyle tells a story about his childhood that transfixes the group, including Mrs. Faye. The old woman ultimately joins in as Grover blows out his birthday candles.Doyle helps Grover learn how to ride his bike. A quartet of white PUNKS confront the group and destroy the bike, calling Doyle a “n***er lover”. Leroy is unable to process the situation and escapes into the first act's closing number (“This Crazy Place”). Satin protests but ultimately gives into the performance, assuring Leroy that what they've just experienced was nothing more than a dream.Act TwoThe next day, Linette expresses concern that she won't be ready for her next number. The performers reassure her that, no matter what they do onstage, it doesn't matter so long as they're undressed “From The Ankles Down”.Satin gives Romaine a note from Grover, thanking her for his birthday cake. Though she is reluctant to accept, Satin agrees to sit in the white dressing room with Romaine and talk about the birthday party. She is unable to reveal exactly what happened on that day. Leroy shows up with a receipt for a replacement bike but Satin rejects his offer, insisting that he can't “keep smilin’ everything away”. Romaine enters the black dressing room to talk to Leroy and encourage him to keep trying with Satin. When Harry sees his wife exiting the black dressing room, he reminds her that they could be shut down for such a violation.Gus introduces a juggling routine to Doyle but is infuriated when his eyesight prevents him from juggling properly. Doyle suggests that they incorporate his mistakes into the act. As they create this revised routine, Satin watches from afar (“Who Is He?”). Gus notices that Doyle is taking notes and insists that a true performer should “Never Put It In Writing”. Doyle gets it (“I Talk, You Talk”) and the three performers come together for a big finish. Satin flinches when she realizes Doyle is holding her arm.When Gus and Doyle perform their juggling act onstage, it ends with Gus accidentally walking off the stage and becoming enveloped in the stage works. Harry declares that Gus is no longer fit to work at the venue. Doyle promises to help his new partner, seeing as Gus was the one to pull him out of the alley and give him a reason for living. Gus tries to appear cheerful but sings a mournful reprise of “I Get Myself Out” when left alone.Romaine and Solly perform a comedy routine (“Timing”) when a gunshot is heard backstage. Harry appears before the audience to report that an accident has occurred and the show has been cancelled. Doyle is shown standing next to a funeral wreath as Maybelle and the company mourn the death of Gus (“These Eyes of Mine”).Leroy and Satin arrive backstage on a Sunday, having been unable to locate Doyle, who has gone missing since the funeral. Leroy takes a moment to clarify that he doesn't view Satin as a one-time girl. He wants to be with her permanently, if she'll have him. Satin is lost in thought and states that she'll need time to think about Leroy's offer. Despite this, Leroy believes he's on the right track and privately claims victory (“New Man”). Satin realizes that the only spot she hasn't checked is the alley and is horrified to find a drunken Doyle being beaten by STREET TOUGHS. She barely manages to pry Doyle out of their grip by threatening to call the cops.Doyle is taken to Satin's apartment, where he drunkenly calls out for his dead wife and son. Sitting up in bed, he catatonically reveals how, when he was living in Ireland, he made a bomb intended to kill British soldiers on a train. It was only after the explosion that Doyle learned his wife and son were on that same train (""Down""). He collapses, and the next morning he reveals to Satin that his real name is Thomas. They kiss, and when Satin opens her door to leave for work she is met with the sight of two cartons of ribs. She and Doyle realize that Leroy must have been outside the entire time.Onstage, Leroy sings about Chicago and “A Century of Progress”. The chorus girls appear onstage with Satin and Leroy proceeds to humiliate her, ripping off her wig and g-string in front of the audience. Satin escapes to her dressing room and is confronted by Leroy, who slaps her. He gets into a fight with Doyle that highlights the color line and causes the company to fight amongst themselves. Henry intervenes and demands that everyone get back to work.Satin appears onstage to sing another rendition of “A Sweet Thing Like Me”. She is interrupted by the Street Toughs, who throw tomatoes at her until she is led offstage by the Stage Manager. Doyle confronts the Street Toughs and the Company spills onto the stage to help fend them off. The group freezes in a moment of stylized theatricality so that Leroy and Satin can be shown backstage. They make amends and Leroy vows to help her in any way that he can, even if they can't be together. The Street Toughs are defeated and the company triumphantly crosses the color barrier, vowing that they won't be segregated moving forward. Leroy, Satin, and Doyle are shown arm in arm once more (“This Must Be the Place - Reprise”).","The story begins in the theater. Not ordinary but a one, working in the style of parody. There are both black and white actors, each of which performs own role in the plot of the show: stripper, former murderer, the actor and the blind guy with own living “puppet”.  Due to the ardent racism, prosperous during the Great Depression in Chicago in 1933, not allowing to share to black and white actors a single stage at the same time, they are forced to hide their close friendship also aside of it, because it is extremely condemned in society, and in addition – is prohibited.  One of the main characters, a black actor Leroy, is in love with a stripper Satin, also an African-American, but he did not dare to reveal her own feelings, making only meager hints, which are, obviously, not enough.  The other two – a comedian fellow Gus and his assistant Doyle. Gus is almost blind person that threatens to him with loss of career and work, and Doyle is Irish, acting as a puppet in performances of Gus. In addition, only Doyle can control the bike, and once, he takes the bike to deliver Satin to a birthday of her younger brother. Unfortunately, vandals, who were supported by the authorities on the issue of discrimination against African Americans, attacked them before the trip.
