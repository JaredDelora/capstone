hamilton,"Can we call a thing more boring than the history? Everyone can remember the long hours spent on the school bench under monotonic and gray monologue of teacher, reading paragraph by paragraph, to enter steadily and firmly in the young stupid heads the chronology from the beginning of times until today. But sometimes there is nothing more fascinating than the history. At all the pages of books, written by bored pundits, contain no drop of inspiration, not a grain of creativity. Musical «Hamilton», created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, is an outstanding example, of how the history should be revealed.  Miranda spent six long years of hard and tireless work on his own brainchild, being inspired by the biography of his native country and its founding fathers, especially the notorious Alexander Hamilton. The plot plunges us into the story of the life of one of the great politicians, says about his childhood, the years of a long and hard studying, and finally, about his formation as a political figure, skillfully touching the threads of fate of great state, during the fight for its independence. The story takes us to the atmosphere of the time, and every detail is thought out so that the film captivates us entirely. This musical is as close to modern musical trends as possible: its motifs include smooth melodies of romantic and lyrical works, and after, the ricochet of hip-hop beats on our hearing. Seemingly boring talks about finances and war, usually prompting boredom on the viewer, now transformed into real musical battles, under hip-hop.  Alexander Hamilton lived before in the minds of only a dry summaries of the handbooks about the history. And his face is on a ten-bill. Now he comes to life and is presented to the audience on the stage as simple, perfectly ordinary mortal person, capable of making mistakes, looking for ways to retreat and solutions, in love or naive, strict or cruel politician – this all matters. He is alive. This story takes us in his journey from the very beginning, proving that we are all humans, no matter how great we were. It captivates and attracts. So much, that tickets on this presentation fly out with incredible speed, and many famous people of our time (for example, President Barack Obama and lots of movie stars) considered it as their duty to attend the musical. And more than once!"

thebookofmormon,"The two missionaries are shown. One of them is the mega-responsible person, worried about the new believers and is slightly arrogant. The second, though, completely devoted to his work, but is a hopeless nerd and very big liar who does not want to adhere sticky to conversational scripts. Some time after they were formed in the pair by their mentor and sent to Uganda where upon arrival they were immediately robbed by the local military junta. The local ruler is a terrible despot, a collection of all the sins of Mankind in one bottle, due to which the population of the country is mired in poverty and horrible unsanitary conditions, including AIDS.  The local population does not believe in the Christian God, and even constantly sings very blasphemous song. The missionaries are already experiencing some frustration, and they were being taken to a place of residence, where another few people live, their comrades who did not succeed to convert locals in their faith. One of the newcomers is trying to start proselytizing, but locals find him arrogant, and his faith as meaningless. In the meantime, the local kinglet comes to village and arranges outrage by executing one of the villagers on the spot. The second of the newcomers decided to proselytize people in his own way and very happy when one of the locals listens to him.  It is interesting that this preacher has never actually read the Book of Mormons. Therefore, in order to draw the public into believing, he invents stories, lively and interesting, which are seasoned with his personal charm and ability to tell interestingly. He includes folklore in his stories, certain general provisions of the Mormon faith, the Hobbits, Star Wars, as well as some information about his father. Locals accept such living histories quite vividly.  His second mate, experienced failure to work with the people of Uganda, throws his partner and wants to go Orlando. During the packing-up, he has nightmares, partly because he feels remorse because he had abandoned him, losing faith in the success. He wants to re-establish himself in Uganda, but the former partner does not want to accept him. In addition, the second has a success – 10 people have turned to the new faith.  The Mission leaders come to them and congratulate with the successes, calling them one of the most outstanding figures in Africa in terms of acquisition new believers. But after the leadership recognizes that they are not taught the natives their faith, but some nonsense, they stopped their mission and imposed anathema on them. Nonetheless, both continued to live together with locals and preach to them the good and understanding, thereby engendered new faith."

The mother of poor inciting him to sell the cow and Red Ridinghood comes to the local baker to bring the pastries to a sick grandmother. The cause of infertility of a baker is the curse of an evil witch, because somehow his father had stolen vegetables from the garden of witch, for which she bewitched his family, taking away from them a little just-born daughter Rapunzel (juridical example of how the punishment is excessively disproportionate to misdemeanor).

In an unsuccessful attempt to enrich, poor man woke up the giant, he chased him until the poor man cutted down the stem, and the giant died from hitting the ground. The dead cow is summoned back to life, she was fed with the remaining 3 magical elements and provided a magical milk, which is actually a potion to a witch, who becomes a beautiful girl and the spell collapses.

jesuschristsuperstar,"The musical begins with a display of the presence of the confrontation between Judas Iscariot and his teacher, Jesus, whom first considers only a man, not a God or His messenger, and criticizes him that Jesus too uncritically accepts all new followers, fearing of gaining popularity among the people by Him. Jesus and his disciples want to go to Jerusalem, planning days, he calls them not worry too much about the future – there will be what will be. Judas reveals his true commitment to Christ, because he worries about his name, and the consistency of the teaching, as Issa has tied himself with a prostitute Mary Magdalene, whom Judas condemns. But Issa tells him that ""don’t judge and will not be judged"", and we all are not sinless, by means of that originating in his follower confusion and anger. When Mary is trying to oil his body with olive oil, Issa is angry that the money could be given to the poor, that is, their current use is irrational. Jesus at this stage shows all the features of the ordinary, though very sensible, person, because there are anger, blame and carelessness about the future present in him.  Several high priests of Rome, watching what is going on with Jesus and his teachings, come to the conclusion that the spread of his doctrine should be stopped, and he himself – destroyed, as an element that threatens to the existence of socio-political system of Rome. All his followers and even those who do not share the teachings are under attack. Because with the fall of the power of the Roman Empire, statehood and civilization will cease too, causing irreparable harm to the public. High priests want to avoid this in the first place. After the entry of Jesus and his followers in Jerusalem, he becomes an aim of attacks, even up to the point that he wanted to make a coup d’état, which he, of course, denies in those words, that in this city no one knows his real intentions. Issa sees that the city, in which he has entered, has become the center of debauchery, lust and arms trafficking, and is horrified by this state of affairs. In one of his most famous scenes of rage, he chases the merchants and moneychangers out of the temple, which is a sacred place.  After that, people starting to arrive to him, unhealthy physically and mentally, he begins to treat them, but their flow is so great that he abandons this idea, proclaiming all they should treat themselves. He does not have enough time to rest. Maria discovers that she is in love with her mentor. Judah does not like this situation, he expressed jealousy towards woman, as he wants that the teacher was close only to him, not knowing that the gift and philosophy of Issa is the property of the whole world. He conspires with the high priests of Rome and sells them Christ for 30 pieces of silver, because he did not want His popularity has increased very high.  At the Last Supper, Judas says bad words to Jesus and come after custody, so they grabbed Him, while the rest of the followers did not do anything to save Him, falling asleep. Issa goes to pray to God so he gave him strengths, coming into the place where the soldiers are ready to capture Issa. He already wants to go back to God, so that he took him, because He feels that he cannot be the salvation for people anymore.  After his arrest, which the apostles could not resist (and Issa told them not to do so), he refused to comment on its further action, is judged first by a court of faith, where preside the priests, and then he was sent to the law court to Pilate. Meanwhile his chief disciple Peter renounces his mentor, fearing for own life, and then leaves in pilgrimage, carrying word of his faith to other people. Issa is transmitted to the king of those lands, so the latter said his final accusation word, and the king even says that will free him if Issa will show his ""tricks"" with healing, but because Christ ignores it, the king is beginning to enrage and assigns the court over him to Pontius.  Judas feels bad, understanding that betrayed his mentor and best friend, wants to repent before the high priests, but chosen own audience very badly and they did not really listen to him and then pushing him out of the temple, dooming him to the terrible pangs of conscience. He interrupts his despair in suicide.  On execution, the crowd calls him to be crucified, and the judges decide that He is no more than an ordinary human being, not a prophet, not a son of God. Pilate appoint Issa different penalty, trying to satisfy the bloodthirsty mob, although previously he wanted to confine a milder punishment, perhaps even his imprisonment, but keeping him alive. But the raging crowd did not allow him to do only some moderate punishment, so he was crucified. All, except of the spirit of Judas, were sad about this event, recalling the changes that Issa has brought in their lives."

singinintherain,"This is the story about Don Lockwood – star of silent films, who began his career as a musician, a dancer and even a stuntman. The protagonist barely tolerates the antics of selfish and superficial Lina Lamont, that is his on-screen partner. Despite this, the studio Monumental Pictures at every opportunity connects artists with romantic relationship. This is done exclusively in order to increase their popularity and one of movies with their participation. Interestingly, Lina herself began to believe that between her and Don there is some connection. But in fact, it is a complete lies. At the premiere of a new movie called ‘The Royal Rascal’, actor tells to the assembled audience slightly embellished version of his personal life. Lockwood also voiced his motto, which is as follows: dignity is always worthy.  In order to get away from his fans quickly after the premiere, Don jumps into the first passing-by car, driven by a dancer Kathy Selden. She responds with a sneer on his works and says that the silent antics unworthy of such attention of the public. Later, at some studio party, its head R. F. Simpson demonstrates the guests of the event the filming picture, but they find it almost unimpressive. They estimated it as something vulgar and frivolous. At the same time, Don meets Kathy for the second time. Now he does a mild mocking on her, but receives a response in a couple of minutes in the form of a cake throw. The actor manages to dodge, and the cake flies directly to Lina's face. Obstinate dancer leaves the party as if nothing had happened. The protagonist is shocked by this act, and he really gets interested in person of his new acquaintance. After several weeks of searching, he finds Kathy working in other studio. She confesses that she has always been a big fan of Don’s work.  After the incredible success of film ‘The Jazz Singer’, released by the studio-rival, R. F. Simpson decides to take the next sound joint project of Lockwood and Lamont. He even has a name of the future brainchild – ‘The Duelling Cavalier’. But on the first day of filming team faces many challenges. The most important of these is certainly a raspy voice of Lina and her strong New York’s accent. Disgruntled diction coach tries to teach the actress to pronounce the replica correctly, but to no avail. Screening results also fail: due to improper placement of microphones, sound turned barely audible. In the middle of the scene, it goes out of sync at all, which adds slightly amusing result.  Don, Kathy and Cosmo enter the studio with the idea to turn ‘The Duelling Cavalier’ into a musical called ‘The Dancing Cavalier’, the basis of which should be a number ‘Broadway Melody’. But the question of what to do with Lina’s voice, remains open. Cosmo offers to sound character of Lina with voice of Kathy. R. F. approves the idea, and the result completely justifies itself. However, this fact expectedly frustrates Lina. She arranges hysterics, threatening to sue the studio, but in the end, continues to work.  ‘The Dancing Cavalier’ experiences a huge success at the box office. When the audience asks the actors to sing live, Lina just opens own mouth at synchronized sound. At this point, Don, Cosmo and R. F. raise the curtain and announce the real star – Kathy.

cats,"It happens 1 time per every year, when the cats horde named Jellicle gather in a common place and decide who will be the next ascender to the Heaviside Layer – some kind of a mystical place. Cats are presented to the audience in order audience to know with whom interaction goes in the musical – as an integral part of the play. From this, we learn about what cats are gathered here and about their distinctive features (for example, the song Mungojerrie and Rumpelteazer or a cat with the funny name Jennyanydots, song The Old Gumbie Cat). Once after the cats ball, the audience learns that the Heaviside Layer is, possibly, some ritual place or both a place and a ritual that would allow one of the cats to reborn to a new life (without showing exactly how it would happen).  Alternately different cats come to the scene and every cat under own song presents himself, with the result that we learn about their character and position in the cat’s hierarchy, and how surrounding ones treat them. For example, there is a large and thick imposing cat, which goes to a club of local cats-gentlemen (or, rather, gentlecats?). Or an old she-cat, whom other cats try to avoid (in the past, she was the star of the theatre but now lost most of the charm). Or we know a couple of idlers, petty thieves and hooligans.  Then the main action begins, when it comes to cat named Old Deuteronomy, old and decrepit, who survived more than one or even more than a dozen of his wives, a mentor who has to choose someone who will follow him in the Heaviside Layer, a sacred place. All the cats begin to dance on the cat's ball, and decrepit old cat Grizabella was trying to dance with them too, but it didn’t work, and so instead she sings Memory – hit song, which greatly added to the popularity of this musical.  After this soulful performance, Grizabella is selected for rebirth and the ceremony of choosing ends with the official song of Old Deuteronomy. On the scene, we see cat Asparagus, which tells about the past own bygone days and as he was known star, but now he is old and decrepit and has palsy paws. Cat Skimbleshanks – mascot of the night train to Glasgow and all the cats are went to the local scrapyard to portray the train – someone turns the wheels made of the materials at hand, and someone shows other details.  Arriving local bully steals an Old Deuteronomy, disguised in his clothes and shows himself like this, but exposed and expelled. Old Deuteronomy returns to the place and the ceremony of ascension begins. Grizabella ascends to the sky on the large tire, sending her recognition to all and a speech until the curtain finals the show."

Irene is charming & fun-loving girl, she needs romance & a gentleman husband. She works in a hat shop in Big Apple, where they are introduced. Along it, the production introduces us not only with the named characters, but also with his shop in Yonkers, as well as with his 2 employees.  Horace comes in own shop & says to the guys that he will depart to find a wife, who will help him with household chores. By that time, Dolly learned a man closer & realizes that she doesn’t want to fulfill the contract completely & to give this man away to other womenfolk. On the way to New York, she if casually mentions that the ex-husband of Irene perhaps, did not die from a natural death & the amiable & charming Irene knows about his condition & inheritance.

jerseyboys,"The whole spectacle is divided into five parts: spring, summer, autumn, winter and the final. This seems a very bold move, the same as logical. Spring is the dawn of a great band, yet unknown, when quite young guys just get to know each other and trying to figure out this life. They come in a variety of troubles, linked with the Mafia, and, finally, find themselves as artists. Summer is expressed in the work within the team, acquaintances and attempt to mutual understanding. Guys are trying to do their best, sing songs together, deciding who and what will do. To put it simply, work out the team work, which, truthfully, only sounds easy. This is shown in a part of the musical, where they try to overcome the ego of each other, staying on the road that leads to a common goal. And, of course, the first successes and concerts end with a full sensation.  There could not, of course, be without problems and confusions, especially in the personal life of men, who became famous, now the idols of many women. And one of them as a result of this, is going through a difficult break-up with his wife. And there comes a ""fall"". Famous and recognizable, they traveled on tours across the country. One of them cares about the success of the whole band and is literally drowning in own work and not noticing the other participants in respect of which all is not as rosy as it would like to be. Debts, glory’s hardships and constant performances, attempts to save the crumbling friendship, women. All of this is sinking in endless faceless crowd of fans, for which you need to play the role of a simple guy, who do not have any problems.  Winter period in the play is at all the most difficult. The band breaks up in front of our eyes. One member of the team leaves the band, because of fatigue. Games are over. The real life, without crowds of fans and autographs, already may seem a dream. Men understand that it is all of their friendship that seemed so strong and true, and it is crashing down with a great name of their band. The problems are multiplying and spreading. It becomes much more difficult not to pay attention to them, not to notice them in the stream of crazy days. They recognize that their relationship has never been ideal, but still earnestly trying to help each other. Everything completely falls apart when from a drug overdose daughter of one of the band’s members dies. The team keeps afloat brilliance and relevance of their songs for a certain time, but the mood is already quite gloomy. Eventually, the band breaks up.  In the final part, in the conclusion, the song sounds, uniting the four soloists for the last time on the stage, and each participant during the execution snatches a moment to address a speech to the audience."

His attempt to escape failed. Nancy repented of her behavior, but Bill did not see anything wrong – that was their life. Fagin thought that he could stop criminal living and become an honest worker.

hair,"The musical tells the story of a certain tribe of people, of the small-sized pride, which grouped persons by common interests – of antiwar sensation, love for different medications, expanding consciousness and free love. Musical is about hippies, ""flower’s children"". Events unfolding with presentation of the tribe and the musical’s hallmark is the fact that the actors move freely among the spectators, mingling with the crowd.  First are the two – high school student-activist and a young man, expresses the freedom of spirit and thought. In the middle of the stage, sits alternately one then the other person, and they often asked by other participants of their changing social group, to make accents. One of the actors appears in a loincloth, and another one says that he is from England, making the fake British accent, while he reminded that he really is from the state of New York. Some of them are dark-skinned, and others are passionately listing medications.  Then in the middle is an eccentric woman who, we believe, is against all the achievements of mankind, as they lead to death, and she doesn’t even know by whom she was impregnated, but apparently, not from whom she would like to have a baby. Participants stand in letters, first FBI, then CIA and then – LSD. Then the participants imitate the speech of one of the parents of these loafers – he does not work, collects some paper trash and they decide to send him to the army and not to sponsor his idle life. He contradicted them, gathering with his odd pals to celebrate that he's alive. In short, he is a loggerhead. Then he still goes to the medical examination of military service in the army and he is given a card, with which he must go to Vietnam, but he does not want such development. At this time, the others continue to be addicted to drugs and take them to have a buzz.  Then they answer the question of why hippies have long hair. It turns out that because a natural and long hair is like a bird's feathers, because they do not cut it (well, not surprising – they don’t have scissors). One of the girls said that the people and their children should be absolutely free, as long as it does not harm anyone.

somethingrotten,"In 1590-ies, William Shakespeare was nicknamed as The Bard. Minstrel told the audience the story of two brothers Bottom, who managed the theater troupe. Their patron Lord Clapham announced that the play ‘Richard II’, which was under the maintenance of Nigel & Nick, would be prepared by Shakespeare. Relatives’ indignation knew no bounds – they knew that the playwright has already created the next part of this story and return to the previous one, according to them, was unacceptable. Lord said that if by tomorrow they would not have a new song, he’ll cease to support the theater of Bottoms.  Returning home, Nick & Nigel met yet another sponsor, who wanted to invest in their production, but according to the law had no right to do so, because he was a Jew. When Nick was trying to take money out of a home piggy bank, he received a comeuppance from his wife. Eventually, the man managed to get to these coins in several days.

He pulled out a sonnet of brother off Shakespeare's hands, accusing the latter in plagiarism.  Soon, Nick went to Nostradamus again. The playwright wanted to find out what new hit will Shakespeare prepare for the show. Misinterpreting the name ‘Hamlet’, the prophet said, that it would be called ‘Omelet’. He also said that the histrionics would tell about the Danish dough. In his dreams, Nick saw himself beating a hated rival. At this time, Shakespeare has learned from a spy that the brothers were hunting after his hit. Trying to find an idea for a new play, playwright disguised himself and implemented in the company of competitors. Naming himself Toby Belch, he learned that the brothers would stage a thing about the eggs. Its production covertly was funded by Shylock the Jew.  Nigel did not like about the idea of the omelet, and he began to write a new play about Hamlet. When the playwright told this brother about it, they had a skirmish that was overheard by Shakespeare. During the premiere, The Bard took off his disguise and accused Nick and Nigel in plagiarism – in their musical were many references to other plays. The court sentenced the brothers, Shylock and Nostradamus to exile in America. Along with them went Bea & Portia. In the New World Nick heard that Shakespeare created the play ‘Hamlet’. Nostradamus was glad that his visions were so close to the truth."

godspell,"The musical starts from the voice of God, whom we don’t see. A group of people sings fragments of the philosophical sayings, merging in dissonant chorus. Then John the Baptist appears. He baptizes people & preaches. After that, all members sing together with Jesus. Christ is announcing that his followers should live according to a Scripture to get to Heaven. He promises to always support those who ever ask him for help. Company starts understanding the Saint & his learning. He teaches them to present gifts on an altar, & they do such presentations. They learn that to come closer to God's altar, they have to be pure with soul & thoughts. Later they represent history of the owner & servant who ran into debt to him. The sense is in forgiving the brothers in all sincerity. Jesus teaches them that if one their part sinned against the Lord, it is better to lose it, than entirely get into a hell.  The community plays a parable of the Good Samaritan. Messiah explains that it is necessary to love the enemies & says that any blessing made of pure thoughts is rewarded. The following that Jesus tells is a parable about the rich man & Lazarus, which teaches that everyone is rewarded according to his doings. One of the people tells a story about the person, who all the life got good things & died earlier, than managed to take pleasure of them. God says that nobody should worry about tomorrow. In the following parable, when the turn reaches Judas, he begins persecutions on Jesus, & Jesus changes a subject.  Further, we understand that the purpose of this meeting was to make a society of love & care from the separated company, which thinks as a unit. To reflect it in the musical, they march as soldiers in army with Jesus as the chief sergeant. One of the community sings a song where he urges Mankind to forget about the conflicts & turn to God. Pharisees challenge Jesus’ power, & he calls them hypocrites while other people sing together with him & throw garbage in betrayers. Jesus foretells that he will be gone for a quite long time; also he foretells long wars & hunger. However, he learns that belief is capable to calm a storm.  Further Jesus tells how he will divide people just as the shepherd divides the herd into sheep & goats. Goats will expect eternal suffering, & sheep will get on Heavens. The community gathers for the last dinner & Jesus says that one of them will betray him. Each of attendees asks, whether it is he or not, including Judas. Christ treats the audience with bread & wine & leaves them for the Garden of Gethsemane for praying. Later he comes back to the followers & finds them sleeping. He asks them not to sleep, but they don't obey him, & he warns them that they will betray him three times. Jesus says to God that if he can't avoid death, his will has to be executed.  Judas comes back to betray Jesus, but, surrounded with invisible walls, he sees only one way, leading to Jesus. When the company tries to stop the traitor, Jesus stops them, saying that who will come with a sword, lately will suffer from it. He also says that it had to happen on a prediction. Jesus dies & music abates. Women & men sing, glorifying God."

Previously, the theater has been successful and very lush, but now it can be compared to a human skeleton from under the skin of which bones look out – boards and drapes seen from everywhere. In the theater live the ghosts of former actresses and actors who already aged considerably – someone is about 60, another already more than 70 years old. The hall accepts guests, former actors, arriving all the evening. Some of them are successful traders; someone even in 66 years remains a coquette. For someone even an opera was dedicated in the past, but she does not remember exactly who did it – only the fact is important. Guests remember their youth, some of them are friends since childhood, someone met in college. Someone was a couple in the past (as Sally and Ben).

They are the weird owners of the nightclub named La Cage Aux Folles (“The Cage of The Crazy Ones”). The place is quite questionable, as can be judged on the appearance of people acting in this club. Outwardly respectable George manages the affairs of the place, trying not to give out in his behavior somewhat unconventional inclinations. His friend Albin is a transvestite cabaret singer (he performs under the name of Zaza). This is a typical, stereotypical and somewhat grotesque image of the homosexuality: Zaza is too feminine, campy, whimsical, and with all his theater-like manners, trying to be like a woman.  But one day the life of two elderly birdies literally turned upside down. Georges is visited by his son Jean-Michel (the result of a light affair in his youth), and says that he intends to marry Anne Dindon. It would seem nothing wrong with that. But it turns out that the girl's father is a leader of a party of fighters for moral purity. This prim gentleman is an ardent struggler for morality, a notorious homophobe and bigot. If he finds out what the groom's father do and about his sexual inclinations – the wedding is off. Now the head of the family and his loyal friend must at all costs try to hide the truth, not to let down a couple in love.  It was decided to do so that before the coming of the bride's parents their house looked not like a homosexual’s couple one, but was as much as possible respectable. An attempt was made to remove for a certain time Albin, but capricious ""diva"" was terribly offended. Nothing can be done: George had to present him as his wife. The head of an unusual family is presented himself as an art person. Accidentally, mutual friend, who does not know what was happening, exposes Albin.  Scandal is upcoming: the parents are trying to persuade Anne to give up the groom, but she loves Jean-Michel very much and is not going to break with him. The situation is saved by Jacqueline, who brings a representative of the press. Paparazzi are happy to shoot the controversial report about the head of the party of moralists, who is in close relations to the canary-transvestite. Georges and Albin offer the bride's parents to hide from papz, but under one condition: the younglings should be together. Chairman of the party of moral purity and his wife, dressed-up as actors in costumes of the nightclub, are hiding from the press. In the final scene, Georges and Albin sing about love for each other.

assassins,"The play about the people who killed several different people, including couple of presidents of USA, among which is Lincoln. One of them, John Wilkes Booth, during the course of the play was depicted as insane, who, above any lofty motives for the murder, just wanted to harm his country and disrupt its social structure. Yes, he was not used to changes, and they became so numerous during the civil war that the mind of the little man could not bear it.  One of the assassins, who tried to kill Roosevelt, killed another person in his place – the mayor of the city – and did not repent of his deeds. On the contrary, he was glad that he had killed someone, ""who controls the money"". According to him, it was good. Being executed on the electric chair, he no longer preached his vile ideas.  The next killer talked about anarchy, and what, in his opinion, may be called as ""social justice"". Their minions talk about the human qualities of Charles Manson, enjoying their own vices. Some of them knew Charles at school. And someone uses posters with Colonel Sanders as a target in a shooting gallery, only shoot him with martial bullets.  Gradually, with the increase of a degree of discontent with communal system in which they live, those who show us through a series of scenes on the stage, get the audience to the fact that they all converge to the murder of the president of USA as the only viable solution. One of these fanatics kills President McKinley.  In the play, we also meet inhumane Lee Harvey Oswald, who is considered almost a god be participants. But what amazes truly, happens at the end of the show – all on the scene charge their guns and shoot at the audience."

1776,"The Second Continental Congress started working on May 8, 1776 in Philadelphia. Massachusetts Representative John Adams was distressed because of the fact that his proposal for the independence of the American colonies were not allowed to discuss. The rest of the delegates, on the contrary, were delighted with these news, hoped that he finally stops to put forward such a demand. Adams realized – Congress does nothing but conversations. After reading the letter of his wife, the delegate did not find the answer to question he asked her. Spouse was more concerned that she had not seen her husband for a long time. The next day, Adams came to Benjamin Franklin. He was upset that the latter did not support his proposal for independence. The delegate also said – a question like this for discussion was best to be promoted by the other person. Virginia Representative agreed to raise this topic in Congress.  When Richard Henry Lee put a resolution on the independence on vote, John Dickinson of Pennsylvania asked to postpone this discussion on indefinite time. Congressmen of five colonies would consider a resolution now, but the opinion of the representatives of the other six states outweighed. Suddenly in the hall appeared the late delegate from New Jersey. He called for discussion of the independence of the colonies, and the balance of opinion on this subject has come. Adams urged the President of the Congress to deal this stalemate with his voice. Dickinson also put a statement for discussion saying that all the colonies should unanimously support the resolution on independence. As a result, the advantage was gained by supporters. John Adams has asked to postpone the discussion, saying the fact that it was necessary to create a declaration, which would clearly describe the laws of Independence. After voting, the delegates formed a committee to develop the project. It included Adams, Franklin, Roger Sherman, Robert Livingston, and Thomas Jefferson.  Soon members of the committee began to discuss which of them would write a future Declaration. Several people took the rejection. As a result, Jefferson was instructed to do that – he was the best writer among present. A week later, Adams and Franklin checked the progress in the work of the delegate. Being in spleen, Jefferson almost did not do anything – he missed his wife, to whom he wanted to go earlier. He was cheered by the unexpected arrival of his wife. John Adams sent for a woman, realizing that it was necessary to support the delegate. On June 22, 1776, hearings in Congress resumed. Supporters of independence have tried to influence the representatives of other states. After reading the declaration a few people went to their side. Soon was adopted a symbol of the future country – the eagle won over the turkey and pigeon, which were also offered by other delegates. During the discussion of the Declaration, many recommendations of congressmen were included in it. The delegate from South Carolina demanded to remove condemnation of slavery from the text. John Adams was against it, but Franklin said that independence was more important than the fate of the black population of the country. With coaxing, they could get the votes of delegates of all states – even the representative of New York, who usually remained neutral. In the evening, July 4, 1776 the establishment of the new American country was recorder officially."

damnyankees,"From time to time on the stage and in the movies there are such films where someone sells his soul to the Devil in exchange for some very strong desire (please mind that always HE sells, never SHE). Here we have an old fan of the baseball team, who longs them to win from Yankees in the World Cup (though ""world"" is, though the official status of these games, untrue, as everyone knows that only the Americans are baseball-addicted and no other nation understands the rules of & have no interest to this game).  So much he wants their victory, that says this aloud that he’ll sell his soul, so they just received some young and talented balls slugger. And here comes the Devil, who offers him exactly this – he takes his soul in exchange for making him a young and very successful slugger who will lead this team to success. But this fan, having a flair, understanding the necessity to leave himself a loophole, also agrees that if he will reach the final game with the team, the soul will forever be considered sold, and if he leaves before the end of it, the deal is off & he gets his life back. The transaction starts, but he has to leave his wife, whom he loves very much.  He was quickly taken to the team and all wildly liked a new player who deals with all the balls. But he is very sad for his wife and is even thinking to go back to her. Devil, trying to prevent this, sent him charming beauty, so that she did her job. As she failed, the Devil sent her down, to sing along with fallen souls.  The Devil sues a player to the court, under false accusations. Besides the fact that the whole thing is delayed, because Devil in human form as the prosecutor is unable to swear on the Bible that he would not lie on his testimony, and the identity of the fan/player does not exist at all, an opposing force transfers him from the court on the game – the very final one. Although he in a second before its completion shouted to the Devil to let him go, breaking the contract for the sale of the soul, he still ends the game, leading his team to a victory. The Devil himself complains that now it takes very big efforts to get only one human soul, not as previously (Those Were the Good Old Days).  Although he returned to his wife, the Devil comes to him, demanding a soul. He asks his wife to hold him tight, which she does. And it turns out that the strength of the Devil is powerless against True Love. He goes to Hell along with his henchmen, and the player happily embraces his wife, and they stay together."

aintmisbehavin,"Such a writer of songs like Fats Waller, who was the Afro American, left a rich heritage and now, based on his singing, they have created and played a musical. Murray Horwitz wrote the book and Richard Maltby actively helped him in this. The music and lyrics were written by many composers and writers for this production – their names are too numerous to mention. Fats Waller had a song that gave its name to the whole musical – ""Ain't Misbehavin’”, which means “Don’t misbehave”.  There is no story in a musical, as such. Everything in it are: different people perform different songs. Men and women. Neat and dressed in evening dresses and suits. And the songs – not combed and not tolerant, having lots of social incomprehensibility, and with such humor that requires visual support to make it funny. That is – the most primitive one. These songs are about the state of the soul in the style of funk, primitive jazz, folk and ethno. This behavior on stage is to show how beautiful you are pulling a suit on or gown named as dress, because your immense figure fits in nothing because you eat unhealthy food in very large quantities. It's about how to go on the stage and sing something without even any hint of development, but simply do the fool, throwing the leg over the other."

kismet,"Fate is one of the immutable things. Everyone, even the smallest one, can give more or less clear idea of this notion. “This is fate” – here & there you can hear such explanation of any event. But more often – of incredible turns in human lives. This skein of fate begins at the East. Three beggars sitting near the mosque & ask for alms. In their talks, they constantly mention the fourth one, whose name is Hajj. He recently left them to go to Mecca. At the same time, near the mosque sits beggar-poet trying to sell his poems. Along with him is his beautiful daughter Marsinah. The poet suffers defeat after defeat, because nobody wants his poems. & then he sees the other beggars.  The man sits down close to them, overhearing their conversations before & he names himself as a cousin of Hajj, being called by the same name. By cunning, he earns a few coins, threatening to all pass-by people, that if they did not leave him alms, he would curse them. & it would be nice, but the new Hajj is spotted by famous thief named Jawan. He is furious & demands from Hajj to remove his curse, which he allegedly imposed on Jawan many years ago, after which his young son was missing.  The poet was no fool. He spotted an opportunity to earn extra money & put the robber a condition: a hundred gold coins in exchange for the removal of curse. Jawan keeps his word & gives the poet hundred gold coins & then went to Baghdad to finally find his long-ago lost son. Hajj met his daughter & gives her half of the amount, so that she could spend the money on own needs & they separate on the market. The same day, in the city there is the vizier of the Caliph with his first wife, the beautiful Lalume. They discuss the bad plight of the vizier, who took money from the ruler in exchange for the marriage of the Caliph on at least one of his daughters, which will be presented at the upcoming reception.  The young Caliph walks across the market, together with his advisor Omar, when between rows notices Marsinah. He is fascinated by her beauty, and, having escaped from the attention of the counselor, walks behind her, until finally catches her up nearby the house, which a girl selected for herself & her father. Caliph slips into the garden behind her, saying that he was a gardener. They fall in love almost immediately & agree to meet at the same place later. Meanwhile, the guards noticed that on the coins for which Hajj buys provisions, is an emblem of Jawan house, known robber & take him to submit to the court of vizier. Vizier do not need any proof of guilt or innocence, he immediately made a Hajj sentence of lashes & amputation of the right hand, but a cunning poet is unhappy with the whole idea, arguing that he is the poet & storyteller & both hands are essential for him. The wife of Vizier, conquered by Hajj, convinces her husband to spare him. But the vizier is adamant: he appoints more strikes to a poet, during which he curses a vizier. And then the guards run in, reporting that they have arrested Jawan.  Rogue bursts into the House of the Vizier & recognizes in him his son, who immediately orders to execute his newfound father, explaining that he is the leading judge & he shall not be the son of the leading criminal. After the execution of the sentence, Vizier realizes that he obviously, is really cursed & wants to proceed the execution of the poet, as the Caliph breaks in with the news that he had found himself a wife & the reception of other princesses may be canceled. Vizier, in horror & delight, offers to Hajj a position of emir & Hajj agrees. The poet does not know yet that the Caliph chose his daughter to be his bride & the cunning Vizier prevents the meeting of the Caliph & Marsinah, lying to the Caliph, that the girl is just his new concubine. But Hajj destroys all greedy & dishonest Vizier’s plans, returning beloved to each other & removing Vizier from the way to receive the gratitude of happy ruler."
