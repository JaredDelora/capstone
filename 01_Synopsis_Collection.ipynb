       "      <td>At the beginning of the XX century in the Paris Opera House was selling of old props. The most mysterious lot was broken chandelier. With its fall relates the story of the mysterious Phantom, who many years ago was the music patron of this place. Chandelier again rose to the ceiling of the theater &amp; time turned back. It was 1881. In the hall was rehearsed the evening performance. Appeared Phantom so angered diva Carlotta that she categorically refused to act. New theater owners replaced the lead actress. The young chorus girl Christine knew a whole party of diva. She perfectly performed in the evening &amp; very surprised new owners.  After a triumphant debut of Christine, she told her friend about the mysterious music angel, who taught her singing. Soon, to her came a new sponsor of the theater Viscount &amp; recognized a girl – in a childhood, they often played together. A girl told to a young man her deceased father’s telling, which included such music angel. A girl also admitted that this mysterious patron taught her singing. Laughed at her imagination, he invited her to dine. When the young man left the dressing room, in the mirror appeared Phantom. He took her into the mysterious world, which was located deep underground. Teaching his protégé singing, the patron brought the girl to his home &amp; when she fainted, he gently laid her down on his bed. Waking up, she went to an angel &amp; took off his mask to see the true face of her patron.  Soon theater owners received a note from the Phantom. He demanded that the main role in the new opera performed Christine. Otherwise, the theater would suffer a terrible disaster. Owners calmed down furious diva, assuring her in her irreplaceability. During her performance, Phantom made so that the singer lost her voice. Trying to save the play, owners let the ballet on the stage. But then the audience saw the corpse under the ceiling, hanging on a rope &amp; heard a sinister laugh of Phantom. Using the general turmoil, Christine took Mr. Chagny to the roof of the theater, where they explained to each other in love. Overhearing their conversation, Phantom has vowed to avenge to them two.  After 6 months, Phantom visited Masquerade. He brought the owners a new musical creation &amp; demanded a main part for Christine. Mrs. Giry told to viscount a story of Phantom. He was originally born with a disfigured face, the boy grew up in a mobile waxworks. When he managed to escape from there, the teenager found refuge in the theater. There he realized that his calling is to compose music. Viscount decided to catch the Phantom. Christine was choosing between her beloved &amp; teacher. Visiting her father’s grave, the girl almost fell under the spell of Phantom, but she was rescued by viscount. During the premiere, Christine realized that her partner should be Phantom. When she tore off his mask, the audience saw the mutilated face of a man &amp; he kidnapped a girl from the stage.  Viscount was in search of his beloved, when Mrs. Giry showed a way to the dungeon, where Christine was forced to wear a wedding dress. Phantom soon caught the Viscount, who found a way to Phantom’s habitat. A man said that would let go Viscount, if only a girl stays with him. Otherwise her lover would die. Realizing feelings of Phantom, Christine kissed him. Having experienced the first time in life someone else's compassion, Phantom was shocked. He told the girl that he loves her, but she forced herself to turn away from her mentor. Christine &amp; Viscount left. Closed by pallium, Phantom started to cry. Soon, in his lair broke angry mob. But under the pallium, people only found mask of a men – Phantom disappeared.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Can we call a thing more boring than the history? Everyone can remember the long hours spent on the school bench under monotonic and gray monologue of teacher, reading paragraph by paragraph, to enter steadily and firmly in the young stupid heads the chronology from the beginning of times until today. But sometimes there is nothing more fascinating than the history. At all the pages of books, written by bored pundits, contain no drop of inspiration, not a grain of creativity. Musical «Hamilton», created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, is an outstanding example, of how the history should be revealed.  Miranda spent six long years of hard and tireless work on his own brainchild, being inspired by the biography of his native country and its founding fathers, especially the notorious Alexander Hamilton. The plot plunges us into the story of the life of one of the great politicians, says about his childhood, the years of a long and hard studying, and finally, about his formation as a political figure, skillfully touching the threads of fate of great state, during the fight for its independence. The story takes us to the atmosphere of the time, and every detail is thought out so that the film captivates us entirely. This musical is as close to modern musical trends as possible: its motifs include smooth melodies of romantic and lyrical works, and after, the ricochet of hip-hop beats on our hearing. Seemingly boring talks about finances and war, usually prompting boredom on the viewer, now transformed into real musical battles, under hip-hop.  Alexander Hamilton lived before in the minds of only a dry summaries of the handbooks about the history. And his face is on a ten-bill. Now he comes to life and is presented to the audience on the stage as simple, perfectly ordinary mortal person, capable of making mistakes, looking for ways to retreat and solutions, in love or naive, strict or cruel politician – this all matters. He is alive. This story takes us in his journey from the very beginning, proving that we are all humans, no matter how great we were. It captivates and attracts. So much, that tickets on this presentation fly out with incredible speed, and many famous people of our time (for example, President Barack Obama and lots of movie stars) considered it as their duty to attend the musical. And more than once!</td>\n",

They were stopped by the pharmacy owner. Angry Anita deceived members of the gang, saying that Chino has shot Maria dead. The pharmacist told Tony about her words, who dreamed of a peaceful &amp; happy life with his beloved. The young man went to Chino, so he shot him too. At the last moment, the young man was able to see alive Maria. Beloved died at the hands of a girl. Members of both bands decided to figure out their relationship over Tony's body.

       "      <td>Good Witch Glinda of Oz country reported that the Wicked Witch Elphaba is dead. They used to be friends, and the memories of their life story in Shiz University started.  Elphaba from the very childhood was a rogue child, being born with green skin color, as her mother had used the green elixir. She also had a sister Nessarose in a wheelchair. When the two sisters came to Shiz, the local bosses took custody over Nessarose. Despite the sociable character of Elphaba, the green color of her skin did not allow her to make friends. Gradually, she became friends with her roommate, Glinda. She desperately desired to meet the Wizard of Oz, who allegedly was able to make her look like of a usual person.  Elphaba had feelings for her classmate Fiyero, even though deep down, she knew that she would never be his chosen one. He replied sympathetically, although he also liked Glinda. But their sympathy had no development – Elphaba was sent to the Emerald City to meet the Wizard. Dreams of help with skin color were not justified at girl – the magician used sorcerer girl's abilities to take credit for her miracles. Elphaba in despair stole an ancient magical book, and ran away being dubbed for that the Wicked Witch and it was declared her hunt down. Using magical powers, the sorcerer managed to escape.  As time passed, Fiyero became a captain of the guard and announced the engagement to Glinda, which was now known as the Good Witch. A guy named Bog was also secretly in love with Glinda, though he was loved by Nessarose, who became governor after the death of her father. When Bog decided to confess Glinda his feelings, jealous Nessa has imposed on him inept spell, wishing to deprive the senses to rival. Bog’s heart began to melt, and in order to save him, Elphaba turned him into the Tin Woodman.  Elphaba reconciled with the Wizard. Fiyero felt again the old feelings to Elphaba, and both of them confessed feelings to each other. Meanwhile, a tornado took Dorothy’s house with her dog Toto, and Elphaba sensed trouble: a house fell on her sister Nessarose and the latter died. It turns out that this curse was designed specifically to lure the evil sorceress out and to deal with her. Nothing was left except of mourn the dead sister and conduct Dorothy and Toto in the way to Wizard of Oz.  Guards found Elphaba, but when they tried to arrest her, Fiyero gave her a chance to escape, and he surrendered. As a result, the guardians tied Fiyero to the pole and carried him to the field to where Elphaba was. To save her beloved, she turned him into a scarecrow Scarecrow, who did not feel any pain.  Elphaba invented to die theatrically in the guise of the Wicked Witch. She asked her friend Glinda not to do anything to restore her good name. Because otherwise, all the people shall be against Glinda. Friends parted forever, and Elphaba gave previously stolen magical book back and promised never again to make good magic, as only misfortune happened to her because of it. They retired with her beloved Fiyero and left in a secret that Elphaba has survived.</td>\n",

The most mysterious lot was broken chandelier. With its fall relates the story of the mysterious Phantom, who many years ago was the music patron of this place. Chandelier again rose to the ceiling of the theater & time turned back. It was 1881. In the hall was rehearsed the evening performance. Appeared Phantom so angered diva Carlotta that she categorically refused to act. New theater owners replaced the lead actress. The young chorus girl Christine knew a whole party of diva. She perfectly performed in the evening & very surprised new owners.  After a triumphant debut of Christine, she told her friend about the mysterious music angel, who taught her singing. Soon, to her came a new sponsor of the theater Viscount & recognized a girl – in a childhood, they often played together. A girl told to a young man her deceased father’s telling, which included such music angel. A girl also admitted that this mysterious patron taught her singing. Laughed at her imagination, he invited her to dine. When the young man left the dressing room, in the mirror appeared Phantom. He took her into the mysterious world, which was located deep underground. Teaching his protégé singing, the patron brought the girl to his home & when she fainted, he gently laid her down on his bed. Waking up, she went to an angel & took off his mask to see the true face of her patron.  Soon theater owners received a note from the Phantom. He demanded that the main role in the new opera performed Christine. Otherwise, the theater would suffer a terrible disaster. Owners calmed down furious diva, assuring her in her irreplaceability. During her performance, Phantom made so that the singer lost her voice. Trying to save the play, owners let the ballet on the stage. But then the audience saw the corpse under the ceiling, hanging on a rope & heard a sinister laugh of Phantom. Using the general turmoil, Christine took Mr. Chagny to the roof of the theater, where they explained to each other in love. Overhearing their conversation, Phantom has vowed to avenge to them two.  After 6 months, Phantom visited Masquerade. He brought the owners a new musical creation & demanded a main part for Christine. Mrs. Giry told to viscount a story of Phantom. He was originally born with a disfigured face, the boy grew up in a mobile waxworks. When he managed to escape from there, the teenager found refuge in the theater. There he realized that his calling is to compose music. Viscount decided to catch the Phantom. Christine was choosing between her beloved & teacher. Visiting her father’s grave, the girl almost fell under the spell of Phantom, but she was rescued by viscount. During the premiere, Christine realized that her partner should be Phantom. When she tore off his mask, the audience saw the mutilated face of a man & he kidnapped a girl from the stage.  Viscount was in search of his beloved, when Mrs. Giry showed a way to the dungeon, where Christine was forced to wear a wedding dress. Phantom soon caught the Viscount, who found a way to Phantom’s habitat. A man said that would let go Viscount, if only a girl stays with him. Otherwise her lover would die. Realizing feelings of Phantom, Christine kissed him. Having experienced the first time in life someone else's compassion, Phantom was shocked.

Everyone can remember the long hours spent on the school bench under monotonic and gray monologue of teacher, reading paragraph by paragraph, to enter steadily and firmly in the young stupid heads the chronology from the beginning of times until today. But sometimes there is nothing more fascinating than the history. At all the pages of books, written by bored pundits, contain no drop of inspiration, not a grain of creativity. Musical «Hamilton», created by Lin-Manuel Miranda, is an outstanding example, of how the history should be revealed.  Miranda spent six long years of hard and tireless work on his own brainchild, being inspired by the biography of his native country and its founding fathers, especially the notorious Alexander Hamilton. The plot plunges us into the story of the life of one of the great politicians, says about his childhood, the years of a long and hard studying, and finally, about his formation as a political figure, skillfully touching the threads of fate of great state, during the fight for its independence. The story takes us to the atmosphere of the time, and every detail is thought out so that the film captivates us entirely. This musical is as close to modern musical trends as possible: its motifs include smooth melodies of romantic and lyrical works, and after, the ricochet of hip-hop beats on our hearing. Seemingly boring talks about finances and war, usually prompting boredom on the viewer, now transformed into real musical battles, under hip-hop.  Alexander Hamilton lived before in the minds of only a dry summaries of the handbooks about the history. And his face is on a ten-bill. Now he comes to life and is presented to the audience on the stage as simple, perfectly ordinary mortal person, capable of making mistakes, looking for ways to retreat and solutions, in love or naive, strict or cruel politician – this all matters. He is alive. This story takes us in his journey from the very beginning, proving that we are all humans, no matter how great we were. It captivates and attracts. So much, that tickets on this presentation fly out with incredible speed, and many famous people of our time (for example, President Barack Obama and lots of movie stars) considered it as their duty to attend the musical. And more than once!  \n",

Tony tried to stop a broke out fight. By chance, he caused the death of his friend from Bernardo’s knife. In anger, the boy killed the leader of Sharks. When there was the sound of police sirens, shocked Tony realized that now on his hands was the blood of Maria’s brother. He was hardly persuaded to flee from the crime scene.  Maria was is ignorance thinking about her beloved. When Chino came home & told about Bernardo’s death by Tony’s hand, woman did not believe him. But then her beloved confirmed this to Maria.

They used to be friends, and the memories of their life story in Shiz University started.  Elphaba from the very childhood was a rogue child, being born with green skin color, as her mother had used the green elixir. She also had a sister Nessarose in a wheelchair. When the two sisters came to Shiz, the local bosses took custody over Nessarose. Despite the sociable character of Elphaba, the green color of her skin did not allow her to make friends. Gradually, she became friends with her roommate, Glinda. She desperately desired to meet the Wizard of Oz, who allegedly was able to make her look like of a usual person.  Elphaba had feelings for her classmate Fiyero, even though deep down, she knew that she would never be his chosen one. He replied sympathetically, although he also liked Glinda. But their sympathy had no development – Elphaba was sent to the Emerald City to meet the Wizard. Dreams of help with skin color were not justified at girl – the magician used sorcerer girl's abilities to take credit for her miracles. Elphaba in despair stole an ancient magical book, and ran away being dubbed for that the Wicked Witch and it was declared her hunt down. Using magical powers, the sorcerer managed to escape.  As time passed, Fiyero became a captain of the guard and announced the engagement to Glinda, which was now known as the Good Witch. A guy named Bog was also secretly in love with Glinda, though he was loved by Nessarose, who became governor after the death of her father. When Bog decided to confess Glinda his feelings, jealous Nessa has imposed on him inept spell, wishing to deprive the senses to rival. Bog’s heart began to melt, and in order to save him, Elphaba turned him into the Tin Woodman.  Elphaba reconciled with the Wizard. Fiyero felt again the old feelings to Elphaba, and both of them confessed feelings to each other. Meanwhile, a tornado took Dorothy’s house with her dog Toto, and Elphaba sensed trouble: a house fell on her sister Nessarose and the latter died. It turns out that this curse was designed specifically to lure the evil sorceress out and to deal with her. Nothing was left except of mourn the dead sister and conduct Dorothy and Toto in the way to Wizard of Oz.  Guards found Elphaba, but when they tried to arrest her, Fiyero gave her a chance to escape, and he surrendered. As a result, the guardians tied Fiyero to the pole and carried him to the field to where Elphaba was. To save her beloved, she turned him into a scarecrow Scarecrow, who did not feel any pain.  Elphaba invented to die theatrically in the guise of the Wicked Witch. She asked her friend Glinda not to do anything to restore her good name. Because otherwise, all the people shall be against Glinda. Friends parted forever, and Elphaba gave previously stolen magical book back and promised never again to make good magic, as only misfortune happened to her because of it. They retired with her beloved Fiyero and left in a secret that Elphaba has survived.  "
